uh you wwelcome to stop in but let me uh make you aware that you know we have our own trucks so the only time i would need anything from penske is if i have a truck down and uh i just need to to rent one for a day or so,1
uhh yes sir uh yeah that that would be fine uh just just cant be extensive but,1
um im actually gettin ready to leave out right now um uh i id rather meet yall at yall office if uh you know this something this to discuss like that,1
i can yeah i can uh schedule a time to uh meet with yall next weekend next week excuse me,1
is is any special time yall want me there or is he gon contact me,1
no uh not not at this time i mean i were just going through a bad time right now,1
well we normally the equipment that we rent from yall are usually twenty six foot boxes wwith a with a liftgate,1
im at five twenty yeah im at five twenty six west chevy chase doug is right around the corner from me,1
no no not at all hes a general tool store i am specifically entertainment and studio rental business nothing to do with the general tool business,1
we we we both we both use fleet works because theyre local and ive been doing business with them forever,1
umm yeah let me look at my calendar real quick and you know im looking at chicagos right,1
and yeah we have all of our dollies and everything in house so we never really rent that uh i think we probably i know last year we were exploring uh leasing options but i dont think that thats my guess or were not were probably not going to do a big fat move,1
but yeah i can talk to ohh what was whats his name whats my reps name again,1
yep uh yeah i can talk to phil again i think i mean like to be honest with you were pretty quiet right now but it never hurts to have you know a ,1
i think we may have discussed this before what we found in looking at leasing a vehicle was um we have to have huge savings if were renting it because we have to uh pay an additional insurance policy um i dont know if you know much if you have thought about that with your customers like um i think were getting away with murder on that one um we rented a truck a twenty four foot moving truck box truck uh lift gate um every day of the every day of the year last year um and theyre like you guys are crazy why if youre going to use it that much why not uh you know a couple year lease and uh youll pay about half the rate we got the proposal from them this is back when i was talking to you about it too and were like its not half the rate its sixty five percent or whatever and we talked to our insurance carrier and theyre like you have rental coverage but you dont have coverage on that vehicle if you lease it itd be another seven or eight grand a year and were like there goes the savings huh so were of a mindset of we dont wanna quote on quote lease one because wed have to you know let them know hey were using this thing every day versus now were doing it and nobody seems to care we even told them we were,1
um thats fine i mean ii just kinda like you do probably blow and go with the wind in terms with what people need um so i dont want to say ill be here on a thursday when some customer may say can you come to kinnesol on thursday so you know have derek uh reach out to me if you want and um im usually here about eighty percent of the time,1
yeah but definitely have him follow up first cause like i said its subject to change late afternoons probably better,1
uh no were uh thats the old uh location were at seventeen fiftyfive purina way sparks nevada where i am and ross is,1
yep umm actually if we could make it uh a little bit later like uh you know umm oh eleven eleven and the reason i say  you know what lets do ten am,1
u n as in nancy h as in henry a as in apple m as in mary,1
yeah thatd be fine uh we are still currently leasing you know we are still under lease on one of our trucks and the other one we own so uh but yeah thatd be thatd be great just in case we need to expand or something,1
um you you know iim here from eight to five every day and its so really just any day was it doesnt matter,1
umm theyre sleepers right now um i may be changing the daycab but just send yeah,1
uhhh actually i have a meeting at ten i could do i could do a one,1

uh okay if you send somebody here to show me what im lookin thats a different story,1
no they need to call me the day before actually uh dont just send them out here uh you gotta call me the day before thats kinda how i like to do things i cant tell you to come out next week because it all depends on whats going on the day before,1
umm yeah yeah umm its kind of hectic right now but uh let me see what uh what uh what would be a good week the week of the twenty third actually would be good cause im leaving im going to be out of the office most of the week next week,1

uh thats gonna change too were we have two locations in belleville the university avenue is one of them but uh our primary address is at fiftythree grills road  thats grills grills road also in belleville,1
sure its uh greg gregg at danville habitat dot org and danville habitat is all one word,1
uh twentyeight oh five liverside drive for gps purposes our zip code is twofour fivefourzero,1
yeah actually uh i would like to do that lets see trying to pick a good time is a little tough to do uh see tomorrows not good thursday how about thursday oh like around two oclock,1
um sure yeah i dont i dont know that were really all that interested in the buy out plan like he like he was looking into but uh but yeah as far as a a new you know if he wanted to quote a new fleet that would be something that wed be interested in looking at anyway,1
well were always looking at uh what our options are were not not necessarily looking to move immediately but we like to know what the competitive price is,1
uhhhh you know what if he can come in tomorrow like ahhh early afternoon between may be noon and two ,1
uhhh you know i am always uhhh we we uhhh own our own trucks but im ill be interested to see what the total cost would be on a like a sixteen foot about little box truck with the lift gate,1
and so we at this moment in time we are we are doing okay as far as wanting to make any decisions with with another vehicle so,1
if if the need does arise i will certainly reach back to you and and see what we can uhhh come up with in the ,1
sure that uhh that is something that we we are open to discuss ummm so yeah if if you would like to uhh furnish us with some of that information uhhh that would help,1
aaaaa yeah i should be available but uhhh check have him touch base with me on monday because our schedule changes,1
we the odds of us having to rent a truck are pretty rare  i am not saying it would not happen,1
you know we have only got like two hundreds trucks  no i am kidding  weve only got no so i am not saying it could never happen  i wouldnt mind if even if someone just email me something i would try to keep it but,1
we we just run two trucks  the odds of us having to rent a truck,1
i am not saying it is never going to happen  i think it happened once in fifteen years when we have may be both our trucks broke down or some but its,1
yeah i dont want i dont want like to say i am in sales so i understand but i dont want to waste anybodys time because you know,1
so you guys are so you are talking the services is what you are saying,1
oh that will be we are talking february fourth yeah yeah that will be fine  if he wants to breeze in uhhh tuesday february fourteenth,1
yeah i guess that will be fine uhhh i would have him call me first uhh we have a meeting between the general manager and a couple of salesmen this next week,1
i know it could be monday or tuesday i am just not sure exactly that day but,1
so far uhh yeah but just like i said just have him call beforehand before he comes may be an hour or two,1
that ififif i know in advance i will just change it or send you an email,1
okay  well the older units are not my problem  its my new trucks that are the problem,1
the leasing company trucks are all those the nonsense all the new stuff the ammations the areaha the after treatment the d p f all of that shit,1
i am i i am leaving here in probably 20 minutes and i may not be back until saturday so,1
uhhhhhhhh you can check with me next week i dont know at this point yeah,1
uhhhhhhh yeah we can probably tentatively set some up for may be the twenty third about ten oclock,1
what day because i will be out of the office but if i am not here thethere will be there will be a guard only here so i i will be here monday and tuesday after that i will be gone,1
ifif he is coming your rep is coming on that day i would like to talk to him,1
because mostly yeah i do not see and he would be coming at elabouck right,1
yayeah because there is one there who was up there i think was bruce i do not know if he still there or not,1
yeah i know  yeah may be tomorrow at ten oclock no but on tuesday at  ten oclock,1
well itititit that number has changed back  it is one zero six industrial  it started at oneosix industrial then they changed it to twotwothreeo,1
coz aah rdo and then they went back after it got consolidate in with c,1
ummhmmm well we i am pretty wrapped up next week uhh you go and push it out another week,1
let me ask you let me ask you a quick question because this be yes or no if i have time  if uhhh if we say we say we need lease trucks from you guys is on a fixed monthly deal or is it payments or monthly payment plus milage,1
well you could you could come out to a yard and talk to me and two of my brothers that are in business with me we could just test things  what is your rate let me ask you a question  what is your rate per hour and uhhh maintenance,1
uhhh most of them are freightliners but mine are all different i have a volvo kenworth and international  my brotherinlaws have freightliners five freightliners and one international,1
yeah i would i would get together with a maintenance package right now because outside maintenance is eating our lunch i mean not going to give high thinking about that it is eating our lunch,1
uhhhh if i knew that we have two thousand they have two thousand and twelve freightliners with with cummins eating our lunch,1
we do not want we are not going to buy anything cummins again  we have been i have been very very uhhh loyal to cummins my entire carrier of,1
we we are using dealers for the most part and it is just eating our lunch,1
hundred bucks  uhh we we pay at one shop hundred and twelve bucks but mostly we get eight five bucks an hour where we go,1
yeah you have to be below eighty five dollars an hour for us to to want a change for what we are dealing because,1
even though uhhh i am i began to work away from dealers and going back to smaller shops that are only fifteen dollar or fifty dollars an hour,1
uhhh you get you know that is a whole lot easier to swallow than eight five right now,1
okay you could come well if you did morning it is better for us yes like a day the morning between nine thirty and eleven because after that we have way too much stuff going on,1
okay  yeah we would like to uhhh have  we would like to be able to know what we want to get rid of our trucks they are just it is no and i think i would rather be able to take all of that uhhh my taxes,1
i get my brother we have a lot of money tied up in our trucks but if we could trade off our trucks as down payments to uhhh be able to get lease trucks were they are new maintenance is lower everything is lower plus you can take the lease off of your taxes every year,1
naaaahh i think the one that reach him was israel so let me transfer to him and see he can schedule something with you,1
so yyou offer maintenance programs programs for trucks ahhh that will be cool yeah i would like hear it,1
okay  yeah you know what next week will be good time ahhh after ten am ahh if you want to do it on lets say wednesday,1
that would be fine  yeah because im to be out of town i believe on thursday friday  thursday friday i will be out of town,1
thats okay  no i just i am just kind of curious to see how you guys are gathering information because this is my personal cellphone and i really give out my personal cellphone out so it must be somewhere haahaahaa,1
no sir never  i really dont i am not interested in rental but i am kind of interested to see what you guys offer for maintenance,1
and then rentals may be may be just to see what you guys will charge for for for uhh you know a refrigerate trailer that that might be the only thing,1
and if he could if he could and if he can bring scales of like what is the even averages or something that shows what you guys are leasing your fifty three foot refrigerate trailer like a breakdown thatll be great because i would i would love im actually looking at trying to sell my equipment and then lease just that i can do as a tax write off,1
right now i have fifteen i have fifteen trailers and i have ahh twelve tractors but if he wants to also bring what if you would charge to lease a tractor that would be also great to give me a breakdown of everything that they fill it as two thousand dollars you guys have two thousand fifteen or two thousand fourteen whatever your figure is,1
if you can bring me somsome prices i know its not going to be you know all this is what what we can potentially lease of you just may be like ahh like a market like an average and you know what we could potentially negotiate on this or you know you know i mean just like we have a gauge,1
aaahh not too better you know  hold on one second just give me one second,1
next week i could probably talk to him depending on what its all about yeah i think i can fillfit him in,1
ahh yeah its probably let me just check my calendar here really quick  lets see what i got  next week todays is fourteenth yeah probably tuesday works,1
and who are you  are you the appointment maker or youll be with the rep,1
will you also put your contact information down there in case world comes to an end and i need to rearrange things,1
maintenance we usually ahhh we well we have they are dependent on this one of our bigger trucks or vans,1
aaaamm we have ahhh i am trying to remember the name its an old pal of ours,1
i think thats and we have a minivan  i am sorry there is a chrysler minivan,1
yeah let me look at my calendar here  maybe aaa actually maybe the week of the thirteenth,1
 aahhh tatatatataataa  national update meeting  could we do could we do ten thirty to eleven,1
what is next thursday second uhh yes i dont let me check my calendar umm i have a meeting scheduled at nine am a staff meeting uh but that shouldnt last but about an hour um so i should be available either before eight or after ten,1
umm well might be do you know if we have an account with penske now,1
well um we probably wouldnt be interested in maintenance or lease right now but we did i believe set up a rental uh account case we needed to rent a truck cause occasionoccasionally we need to rent a truck for a short term,1
who would i talk to to find out if we actually have an account now,1
we just uh yeah it happens we we just find the repair shops that are available and send them there,1
would that be uh only if we had some maintenance agreement thing with you or,1
uh yeah yeah should be able to yeah thatd be fine this is for truck rental and stuff like that,1
uh email would be its mswartz at arnt arnt asphalt and then a co like company dot com,1
uh probably sometime in the next couple weeks im going to be in houston next a week and a half so sometime after that,1
my name is holly wallace and then uh email is hollywallace two seven like twentyseven the number at yahoo,1
yeah stop him out you know weve got were loaded up on units right now really but,1
ummm let me look here  yeah i am not shown anything  sometimes fridays can get a little dicey but uhhh that should work uhhhaa,1
i dont want to talk to him  i used to work for penske six months ago,1
hahahaa yeah you can you can send him in and he can try to convince me,1
she she does she did she did something around your uhhh your fleet side scheduling maintenance or something recently took a job i believe on the purchasing or procurement side  her last her married name is gajewski,1
but its its a combination of you know of of wine trucks bucket trucks con and then and then a fleet of a pretty substantial fleet of light duty pickup trucks so coloradosf one fifties that kind of stuff,1
yeah one fifty probably but the kinda like i say its a you know probprobably by the time they throw buckets and,1
yeah yeah yeah we have four five mechanics that do a lot of the basic repairs state inspections that kind of stuff yeah,1
uhhh the bigger stuff gets sent out  we we have a relationship with uhh if its on the if its on the equipment side of the vehicle most of our stuff is altec,1
so so goes to an altec shop and there are couple of those down in this area,1
and then if its if its a cab chassis thing i aa you know im not sure i know theyve got a lot of internationals over there,1
aaa so so it probably goes through probably goes through that depending upon you know warranty and all that,1
aaa but that seems to be thursday and monday mornings seemed to be the ones,1
and and so they may they may already know each other or there may already be a story and an answer there everybody save every running steves name by him and if that conversation has already happened there is no sense,1
and again yes steve would have the perspective of  you know what do we buy what we you know so what we buy what we lease,1
yeah that that kind of you know here because i i im pretty sure we buy the big stuff,1
i am pretty sure we buy the big stuff and lease the small stuff but thats just a level of detail i havent gotten to but anyway so so steve would id have steve join us so his history or his files you know relating to steve or or conversations would probably be helpful ahead of the you know ahead of the ,1
yeah i am i am so i i i am thevise president in charge of a a bunch of corporate services one of which is fleet and procurement and warehousing and all that kind of stuff but steve is one of the yeah,1
aaa you know what  ive never emailed him from the outside i can hahahahhah iii email him from the from the inside all the see if i can figure out how to look and what see what his uhhh figure out what his internal email is its one of those things no body asks you  yeah s,1
fifteen isnt good  fourteen isnt good  no id id right now probably right now the best day for me would be wednesday the eighth,1
were were well actually you know yeah were i am in manassas so were were,1
next week is not good  we have got three people off soshould be all right,1
yeah and aa definitely interested in it  we have three trucks uhhh two sixteen footers and a twenty four footer,1
umm the two sixteen footers are about a year and half old we bought them brand new from gmc,1
yeah were were about  were only about six miles away from the previous location just more retail oriented space and all,1
after one o clock or or friday friday anytime after eleven o clock is fine,1
we take it aaa we take it where we bought it from aah we bought it from miller ford and they have a pm package so we need take it to them they do all the dot inspections all that stuff,1
uh monday and tuesday are going to be crazy busy days is that you think that you can do wednesday thursday or friday,1
umm im not sure  i have got an appointment outside of the office at nine so there is a good chance i wouldnt be here by ten,1
uhh and probably a little bit later but i mean if there is another day that youre going be in our area and,1
uhhhh lets see what we got here  uhhh let me check ive got weve a got job there that were doing,1
that is supposed to be an all day thing but im not sure that im going to be involved with it all day uhhh,1
yea but i gosh yeah i dont know you know there again thats probably dont start in the morning  ill probably be available in the uhh in the afternoon,1
yeah oh yes thats fine  you know if you dont mind just checking in with me you know on that on that tuesday and then ill kind of you know let you know where im at and then if you guys are still in the area i guess youre gonna be up here seeing some other trucking companies in the mount airy area ,1
uh yeah i believe so yes i do not if anything changes but as far as i know yeah it works very good,1
um let me see um but  the only days i have open next week or two is tuesday and wednesday,1
uh its uh hold on a second uh and you we are going to do it here at the jackson office,1
yeah we are just right down the street from the your guys lot over here  its twenty four o three east high street,1
yeah theres a couple things uh im im im glad you called i was looking for an email you had uh  we had emailed a couple things last year and i and so uhh  i i must have misplaced it in my numerous folders but uh about some possible uhuh truck rental uh needs i may need uh this coming year so yeah so yeah we can go over that,1
thursday im back at uhh like im here on mondays and then im not back in the office till thursday and friday and saturday,1
umm well i am not sure if the full service lease is gonna be the uh way i need to go,1
uh because we usually uh the prices what you know thousand dollars or more a month per vehicle,1
okay  let me ask you this  do you have by any chance uh you know step vans do you have access to step vans too,1
uhaaa  i am not in my office to where the calendar is that uhh probably do i think its uhh i think that might be a good day,1

uhhh well now we were there but we also have another location where im at,1
yeah well its uhh all combined for both of em andfew more here in several months,1
yeah we can do that uhhh  i aint im not in a big need now but im always a wise planner and i would think uhh you think at least in order to where i can when i can,1

i have not a clue what ill be doing next week i dont i really dontwe can set it and hope for it and just shoot park off uhh to be honest i i really dont know ive got to uhhh i got go out of town for a day or two to take care of a motor my motorcycle ups to north i dont know one day and i dont know exactly what day thats gonna be so you know thats what i am saying and theres just things top of each other but yea well be well be still trying to get going,1
just just to let you know that we uhhh our fleet gets subbed out to bellingham auto every year,1
yeah sit down and look at and evaluate our fleet being if so many new ones or newer and so many old ones and what they think might be done and then they can come up with a price to maintain it for the year,1
uhhh ken oh let me grab that to make sure ive got the right one,1
yeah you can stop by and give me the rates ill take a look at it im interested,1
well i i have peters kinda the guy thats the rep that ive dealt with before is he still there,1

im out i am out the seventh and the tenth chew when do you leave best for me is the eleventh or twelfth after eleven thirty,1
uh i tell you what how i would like to handle that just drop by what information you have on any units that you have because we already have uh a fleet of tractors and a fleet of box trucks,1
yeah  just tell him to give me a call before he comes because im im in and out,1
yes maam  we uhhh weve done this before and it doesnt work out but ,1
were poultry company we have to do our own maintenance  were in the middle of nowhere where you still be going,1
our corporate office is in is in alabama but my office is at in bay springs mississippi,1
next next week would be good because ill be ill be in my office next week,1
yeah look and and i wouldnt mind seeing keith at all  the issue ive always had is the uhh the security deposit,1
so thats the one thing that has been holding me back is uhh having to pay the security deposit but uhhh but if we can and i know at one point they were talking about trying to figure out how to may be wave that for me since ive been with you guys for a few years,1
so thats one of the things thatd be important to me so but i dont mind talking to keith at all but uhhh but thatll be one of the sticking points okay,1
yeah  you know itll be you know moh youll meet my brothers  uhhh hold on minute please okay,1
im sorry about that my brother yeah you can stop in here to be meeting my brother i in the office and well if my brother takes care with the truck and maintenance more than me you know sorry ,1
uhhh yeah  i dont foresee i should be here you know  he wouldve i wouldve done on my calendar best thing to do may be call who is ever going to stop in may be give us a shout uhh monday just as a reminder you know,1
could be yeah which all i have to do would be to have the keys to the trucks,1
ummmummm yeah i wanted to look at them but i i actually have kinda like a little local mechanic,1
uhh theuhhh the problem is i am like the only guy in the office right now,1
okay  well i dont know if any gaps that we have  we have umm our own maintenance people our own mechanics umm so ,1
not looking to sell anything  we just umm we just bought uhhh couple of new trucks and i think were okay on those,1
the only thing we get outsourced is if we have an issue that requires the computer to be hooked up to it uhhh thats the only time but we dont have the specialized equipment for ummm you know diagnosing a computer issue,1
ummm well tell me exexactly what that is uhh when ummm do you have all the analyzers for all of the different models of trucks,1
okay  all right well i dont mind the guy coming in ummm he might it might be better if he just talks to our mechanic and sees in that way if there is any gaps he would know about them,1
uhhh lets see  yeah i would uhhmm id say tuesday would probably be the best day next week to meet,1
uhh also and when you say that this is for the new units can you give me both of them,1
yeah you can have him stop in but we do all of our own work and stuff like that too so,1
uhhh its hard to say every day is different for me and stuff like that so,1
but i mean he can come in but you know if you never know what happens  you know ten minutes now i could be doing something else too thats the thing so,1
one phone call so yeah  just have him give a shout and just drop in,1
yeah tell him one oclock uhhh i usually leave off  if im if im in the office i leave by three,1
yeah im just getting ready to walk into the building here but yeah sir good morning nate,1
yeah lets uhh i wouldnt mind sitting down listening to some go for next week,1
uhhhhh that should be fine  uhhh lets go bit more lets do uhhhhhhhhh like eleven oclock something like that,1
have her call me this is my cell and because my days change all the time so uhhh she can shoot me an email but itd be nice to have her just follow up with the phone call in case i dont catch the email its unsureill have her meet uhhh i have my dad in the office there as well ummm thats the only reason were in the process of moving from six fifty five down to sipe road ummm and ill give her that address when i know the number of it uhhh its only its one exit down so uhhh so we will sort that up and then umm its on the maintenance side of things right more or less having you guys help with some maintenance yeah i would like to lease things but ummm id like to talk to her about some numbers but i run all daytime single runs for fedex so i could just never make the numbers work you know the payments are too high with the uhhhhhohh with the extra ummm maintenance or whatever it is you know the five cents or or and i couldnt i just cant ummm think up the paying right  yeah its always three four thousand dollars a month something like but ill sit and talk to her for a second okay,1
oh boy hahahhaha its hard to say  i i never know where im going to be  im in ohio right now,1
if he call if he calls me ill give him direction on where i can meet him,1
uhhhhhh i like to probably do it lets see let me look at the calendar  today is uhh six  i can probably do it uhhh eleventh i think i got tenth,1
yeah sure  you know my problem is is giving the appointment time is tough service calls is tough  ummm if he is in the area he wants to give me a call and say hey im ten minutes away could i stop in thats the best way to do it,1
good question huh  well actually you guys are little late because weve already weve already renewed not renewed  we chose a different vender but weve already solved that ,1
no i dont know if theyre really truly a competitor of yours or not uhhh oh i guess they are because theyve provided us with the equipment we needed but uhh its met metro truck leasing,1
yeah and you know mostly if theyre kinda right extra where we are up there and we about a year ago we got a sample vehicle from them as a umm replacement for one of ours as it was wearing out just to see how the relationship would pan out and what not and weve been very successful with it so decided just kinda try and take it to the next level on the additional vehicles and probably not two months ago we finalized our deal with them,1
uhhhhhumm west vigo which is new orleans is coming up on and well of course its its its two thousand eighteen but you know,1
yeah yeah its a five year deal you know  well start looking probably mid next year for well yeah mid next year for some sort of a solution,1
well no ill take that back ill take that back lease expiring one fifteen of eighteen so thats,1
yeah sure i mean i dont want to rule out any any possibilities you know we did we we im not assuming that anybodys gonna get me what i want at the rate that i want,1
anymore  we traditionally were doing all of our business through ideal leasing and we we got into uhuhuhuh you know both parties probably have some responsibility but primarily they didnt meet our expectations on a deal that we had it went south and they did the last man pull the plug on an agreement we had so we had to file three vehicles that was a brutal haha which we we we dont really want to do that so sure enough of all things our customer decided theyre gonna operate their business differently a year later so now were stuck with three seventy thousand dollar over the road tractors with no home for them hahaha and uhhh you know during the whole transition period where we went from leasing and having service and everything to having to purchase them  they had clearly communicated to us and they have an in service situation  these were at uhh united rentals all of them yeah and as they brought them back in they would completely go through them and they did not,1
so when they delivered to us  one of them was in high point and it was high point industrial and it it was done uhhh iit looked great on the exterior but come to find out the regeneration systems and the filters and everything,1
that that that thats uhh ideal lease was supposed to look at and review and replace before they put the rugs and put trucks out for sale they didnt do any of that so cost was almost twenty thousand dollars a vehicle,1
it was very painful and its even worse now because we are sitting on all three of them and nothing to do with them so yuyuyou know but i mean we even asked them hey throw us a bone just you know i mean and you know you know weve bought them out like for you sure you made a bunch of money on the deal because they are already come off lease,1
and uhh you know nothing so we uhh we we dont do business with them bu in may be two out of the fifteenlocat sixteen locations we have anymore and and we wont be doing business with them on those as soon as the lease would expire so but yeah are you talking about somebody thats based in raleigh or where would this person be,1
wwell let me explained something to you not that im not willing but let bygones be bygones but i wont be doing any deals with him,1
uhhh and i would be happy to work with penske uhhh given that theyre all things being equal but it wont be with watt,1
i owned my own big distribution company at one time and we probably had ummm tentwelve trucks with the with them,1
uhhh and things as i changed my business model and tried to work with them on turning some different vehicles and renewals and various different things and it got really ugly and watt was at the center of all that decided to part ways permanently you know hahahahha im just telling you like it is ,1
yeah i think there is a guy and i was just looking at this the other day ummm  i want to say his name is joe  he is up in the north raleigh locate yeah and iactui actually sat down with him and i gave him our spread sheet of locations and expiration dates and everything,1
well i work out of my home so im not in an office per se i would i would make an appointment with them and i would probably go up there and just discuss various different things to them i mean we were probably a few dollars away from doing then that mount holly deal with the ryder folks and uhh theyre still maintaining those big units that i already talked to you about  we have a maintenance agreement with them and we are going to put those back in service pretty soon so uhhh you know we are not opposed to doing doing that that stuff but we ended up in there in mount holly they were jockey you know yards switcher trucks,1
yeah so we ended up going with left one for the maintenance fees was ea better and easier for us plus they had rentals on site you know in case you had a catastrophic breakdown of some sort you know thats where ryder kinda lost out so im not opposed to working penske ryder metro,1
well the week after next would be better because next week im actually supposed to sit down with the insurance company and we are going through all the list and and i have to do a bunch of preliminary work do agreements and stuff and i need to stay on top of this ,1
yeah no there is no need  we do all of our maintenance ourselves and and if we do partner with anybody has be through a contract,1
uhhhhh currently i have well i got 20 vehicles in total but uhhhh had some issues with my straight trucks  i got maintenance issues costs are getting ,1
uhhh i bought a cash to used but i i have two trucks down and im renting 26foot straight trucks right now,1
next week is our annual meeting and so its going to be a very busy week  uhhh were getting prepared for that so it might be better the week after may be or,1
uhhh no i dont im pretty tied up right now im about to have a meeting in about couple minutes,1
uhhh yeah why dont you just go and email me and i reply to you uhhh about the time i have available,1
it doesnt matter just just i know ragin  tell him tell him to give me a call whenever he is in the area,1
uhhhhhhmmm let me think a minute uhhh far as i know babetter check back with me on monday because i dont know if driver dont show up i gotta get the truck and go,1
no no no  all would be that im interested in is buying a used truck if you got one the used twenty six footer ,1
yeah yeah were at the same place we do most of our leasing through uhhh enterprise and uhhh there is unfortunately there uhhh theyre more price their pricing is better than yours plus they are much closer closer,1
yeah and and you guys have been right here before the run i have no problems  you guys good at trucks  im renting trucks for you before but what i need is uhh im trying to get away from the leasing trucks anyway so thats why im looking for  thats why i want a twenty six footer uhhh thats why im looking for another truck  ive got two trucks with me and im im looking for another one right now ,1
actually i i got uhhhh i got a sixteen and a and cargo van twenty six  i need a twentysix footer,1
ummm next tuesday yeah umm i mean were super slow right now so i mean really be a waste of his time and mine,1
is on is on howard streetill see if i can stop in to see him,1
yeah im gonna try to remember so just tell him to give me a call on monday and remind me,1
ummm i thought yall had all that in the system because i have been dealing with yall for the last twenty years,1
uhhhummm yeah no  i mean you can so if you wanna send me a quote uhhh they have to look at it ummm but yeah uhuhuh i dont have a time probably in this month uhh so what can i just uhh to sit down so,1
uhhhh were leasing two twenty four foot straight trucks uhhhhh thats coming in as refer units uhhh twenty whatever brand or cl so twenty five thousand,1
uhhh sure i mean weweve been with penske before uhhh i mean uhh say like theyre youre probably only more expensive than ryder so uhhh but uhh  yeah i mean i can still yeah ahhhhh yeah ummm wednesday the twenty six like after one oclock,1
well does that does that go for steve too on orangefield road because thats who i get all my trucks from,1
okay but ii im going to tell you that i go i go to steve on on owens road and pick up my trucks,1
and he is a penske dealer  he is um i mean a penske something  i think i pens i like penske trucks,1
well i ive got you down for ten oclock on tuesday thats fine but uh i mean and if you give me better prices than what im getting now thats even better but im still going to go back to to steve on orangefield road,1
no  used to be but then kids could send out uhh not a take over but uhh,1
i guess you say consolidate yeah  consolidate to mcarthur is now calling thats actually the corporate office now,1
ummm it was based on lets say here who who who who that branch dealt with,1
and then uhh they gave uhhh the corporate office and start repeating all down what should be improved,1
the things along that line if we were happy if everything is going good and then ummm they would give us a load and break it down and say okay youre gonna be dealing with so and so and so and so so,1
ummm right now its a combination  ummm we do own couple of tractors straight aa trailers straight truck ummm so im not exactly sure if we are going to go full out  own or we are going to mixed it up a little and then im not a hundred percent sure  this just started happening since don retired,1
yeah this they are as for ryder trucks uhhh see tractors i have one two three three tractors,1
one two three fours five straight trucks especially straight trucks ummm with equipment on them,1
ummm they could be a curtain side dry wall boom a moffett on it or a three wheel forklift or see i got that stuff and then i also have can think ummm i have forty eight for trailer with a moffett hook up on it,1
thats all ryder right now and the one one tractor with waldie one trailer with the walde and fifteen feet cube van with the walde,1
so im all oh and then uhh three i have three two flatbeds we just purchased,1
lets see here  the stuff we own im waiting for sphere i got quotes out from waldie ryder as of maintaining the equipment,1
so hey thats still up in the air  i gotta wait for hmm   all my bosses above me to give me an answer with what they want to do  i do the leg work till i guess go with this one milwaukee so,1
yeah  if he could do because i do you guys have your facility there is a facility oh gosh i believe uhhh a five minutes for me depending on how many legs you have,1
corporate office has a nice guy  nice guy up there but he overseas oh all of us which is all of milwaukee installation all of mcarthur all the sa hes got uhh about thirty three thirty i guess i cannot remember exactly thirty four branches total from here to uhhh west coast,1
so then basically once he does uhhuh a road trip he likes to take a few days off and then spend some time with the family so,1
ummm that is for two flatbed trailers that we own  we just purchase some in december,1
theres one in one came in december one came in january but purchase date was in december,1
uhhh i think so but what i really need you to do i have got a shutdown starting next week and i dont mean i wouldnt have time but i need you to call before you come just so i i know that ill ill have time  if you call me tuesday morning umm at about eight or nine i can tell you for sure,1

they all they all actually sale your old waste trucks once you take them out of your fleet uhh what you all do with them,1
okay  we have never done that right before but our problem is that when we when we go and we are going sometime pretty long distance we dont uhh dont want to take a risk of you know uhh a new truck uhhuhh a new truck can breakdown too  we have had that probably it lowers the risk when you when you start up with a new truck you dont have,1
it itll be next week because im getting ready to go out of town for few days so im ,1
uhhuhh rental i mean with are we talking about vehicles or equipment or with what we ,1
i dont i just dont understand what we really need to talk about  i mean we we dont lease vehicles  we purchase them i mean but who spoke with patrick you did,1
yeah but i mean what just give me little insight here  i mean im just kinda busy really next week  i mean why do we uhmm i mean i know we are enterprise  we met with him before i mean in in you know probably talk to kinda same situation im sure you guys are gonna offer to us but uhh whats kinda give me little insight on what were what were mainly talking about here,1
uhhh let me see a minute uhhh probably probably wednesday or thursday probably better for me,1
yeah yeah heiskell is right down the road  uhhh im at at the office of our west knoxville in a different location so,1
but i mean i i dont to i dont care to meet and talk with somebody  i just dont want the whole group brought in here you know,1
yeah i just want to see what you got to offer and then we go from there i mean but i mean or i mean have you got somebody this week or i mean if they want to come by,1
thursday and friday ill be thursday and friday i wouldnt be available so so im trying to going out so,1
okay let me look into see  i mean youre calling to make appointment for him,1
yeah  well uhhh yeah i mean either one of them can show up i guess and they have been here before and talked to me  they can go from there certainly,1
uhhh im up in birmingham la luckie i am talking about my my phone numbers mobile numbers are just gonna lead you to ,1
yeah we you know we do all of our we do all of our maintenance all of our buying and all this and were not were not interested in in formalities and so to speak so,1
from uhhh work from them mobile all the way up north to uhh to birmingham,1
uhhh my actual address is uhh is in calera alabama uhh i just moved up there so uhhhahaaa its the highway highway uhh seventy highway eight seven,1
its calera alabama and i dont know the zip  im paying on my so i dont know i,1
well i mean he can as long as i can find some time to meet with him  i mean i uhhh i dont uh do any uhhh equipment maintenance from the outside ,1
cant uhh i cant tell you one minute or the next what time slots open so,1
uhh i couldnt speak for tom  i dont know what his schedule is but uhhh,1
i believe i talked to bob quite a few months back  i told him that id have to check with certainly my brother uhhh,1
and i dont know exactly i think he was trying to talk to me about lease program but im afraid it would be uhh waste of your time because my brother who is the accountant has basically told me that we are not going to do any leasing so,1
i have got one of my main managers off on thursday and friday so can you do it before that,1
uhhh well i guess i do but uhh we dont need any trucks right now,1
uhhhhh sure he could drop in  i dont know if uhhhuhhh we have any uhh interest in it but never know until i listen,1
were at seven uhhh five forty five deerhurst drive unit two that is in brampton,1
yeah he can stop by monday next week and im uhhh go over the stuff it might be possibly wedwednesday because i got work on monday and tuesday,1
uhh see the next so next week would be either monday ummm will be the only day uhh open and then after that is second week in may,1
lets see uhhhh next week uhhhhh looks like may be uhhhhh probably can do it on the uhhhh looks like may be monday tuesday or wednesday the twenty sixth fourth fifth and sixth any of those days works,1
its usually in the afternoon after lunch or or like morning if the if the earliest we dont need i dont usually schedule anything till after ten thirty,1
if you want to uhhh you want to shoot me an email or anything and something comes up i can get back with you if something happens,1
yeah i mean i have got i think eight of my eleven trucks come due in february,1
we did do a six seven year deal with muskeralla in the nineties worst human being in the history of human beings lied through his teeth on everything  i swear on fifty bibles i would never do business with penske again to see we just uh and i have been with uhhh inland paclease ever since  i have been with them for like sixteen years and uhh i mean you can send the penske rep in,1
but uhhhuhhhh i just i had a horrible experience with penske you sound very young and you probably wouldnt be even there twenty years ago or whatever,1
it was everthe trucks were garbage everything about them fell apart the full maintenance lease was a crap uhhh he left for me to die me to death and uhhh just wont return phone calls didnt work you know and uhhh im a grinder you know i have been in business for thirty eight years were not a big company were were not i mean we got eleven trucks you know but uhhh bottom line is you intrigue your worst enemy i mean it was  he came in here and just gave the greatest little proposal uhh presentation ever  because were buying our trucks you know and uhhh he had a little competitive to ours but a friendly competitor uhhh kilmer wagner wise in garden grove and he had just cut a deal with greg wise uhhh you know for five six trucks and you know and what a great deal it was but well  and i cannot tell you how bad our deal was it had nothing to do what were paying per month and everything  it was just penske didnt keep the trucks up uhhh trucks were down all the time the rentals that we were supposed to you know the replacement trucks were never available and like our trucks are twenty six foot box and uhhh he he was putting down a fourteen footer haha you know and uhh trophy that lasted like two hours you know and never an apology and uhhh just worst company to do business with ever ever so but if you guys it has been like sixteen years so or may be the longer may be twenty years but if you guys have gotten better and muskeralla is no longer part of the program ,1
yeah i might even be able to go back in my old records from the nineties and literally tell him exactly in detail what penske did to me records and it was not good,1
yeah every every if we you know uh i mean when i i do my own contracts and uh every i and every t is dotted  i mean there is i having done this for thirty eight years  i can pretty much foresee any possible you know uhhh situation happening and i want it in writing what the company is going to do,1
ummmm have him have him email me because i dont know if im going to be uhhh here in the office next week,1
im probably traveling so uhhh have him send me an email and then i could give him my uhhhuhhh i guess my schedule uhhh probably we could we could schedule something probably not for next week though uhhh,1
so probably when i get back we could for sure uhhh i could uhhh schedule with him  i guess he could he could stop by and show me that no problem but uhhh,1
but its gonna its gonna to be probably by the end of the month  okay,1
so yeah i mean iim pretty much uh free in the afternoons after one thirty,0
no were good we when we when we need a truck we we come to you guys come down to see you guys,0
im good thanks im good im iive got it taken care of here locally thanks,0
uhh what do you need why you im kind of busy what all you really need im not leasing no trucks or renting no trucks right now or nothing so,0
nah i we weve got this guy weve been using for about fifteen or twenty years and i wouldnt switch for nothing in the world,0
oh okay uhh well i dont do anything you know i dont i dont lease any trucks or anything i dont rent any truck i got my own,0
uhh ive got extra i mean ive ive only got one driver and i got three trucks so,0
okay now if you want to check back in with me later if anything changes thatd be great,0
uhhhh im not really looking to lease anything right now probably not interested umm towards like this the third quarter of this year,0
uh i i do some myself so i i have a lot of lease equipment so they do their own,0
uh i dont know i dont know because i just got some and uh i just changed my fleet around,0
itll be itll be itll be out there somewhere probably ryder because thats where i got them from,0
uh really not at this time because of what ive just done so i mean im in the process of doing it right now and,0
no you know we havent simply because aand and god bless penske but uh hes a competitor you know he hes taking work away from the companies that i do business with and its hard to support your competitor,0
well we do all i mean we will rent a truck when were short but you know penske comes in and logistics and they and they bid on these runs theyre taking drivers they have the trucks they have the resources god bless em i dont but its taking work away from me and ryder just took business away from one of my one of my customers and uh you know its hard to support aand uh no offense ,0
no we do the the smaller stuff the oil changes tires grease job the bigger stuff goes over to our shop right around the corner from us and hes really done fantastic with me,0
yeah we have our own techs and weve got you know other um garages that we work pretty closely with theyre able to turn the vehicles around for us pretty quickly,0
yeah everything i mean literally uh so um weve even gone back to uh uh whats his face uh docat on a couple of engines of theirs um yeah theyre right in the area i mean theyre literally right around the block from where my boss lives so,0
oh gotcha no actually uh i think were set though cuz we uh we use the um the old gm um um we use the fleet um gm fleet,0
yeah uh for the most part uh were um our uh our entire um region over here were using the the fleet,0
yeah just this pc we have uh we have two service trucks we have a um uh stick bed uh f four fifty and a boom truck,0
you know what joe i appreciate it to be honest with you we we just got all our new vehicles within the last six months um so were not really in a position for many years right now where well be looking to add on to the fleet at the moment,0
you know we we bought a new truck so i i think were probably not going to consider leasing at this point,0
i not uh i dont i dont think so um nope not at this time,0
uhh what what kind okay what is this now uh uh what is it im so sorry im in traffic right now and im about to get on a conference call um can i have you can you can you call me back in one hour,0
uh beats is there any information like an email or something like that beyond that were not really interested like were not really doing anything uh we got a truck a new truck last year ah probably at least inaudible,0
and that i think thats what the plans are for this year is wants to buy another one,0
uh we take em to uh its not well its from uh oxford georgia thats where we take em to to get em their pins and everything we were usin yeah we were usin somebody local but we just didnt have much luck with them and we just started goin all the way to oxford georgia but thats where that auto shop is and we havent had a problem since so they must be doin somethin right,0
oh yeah that sounds good like i said it was weird that he just decided to buy stuff instead so,0
uuuuh well were just a one person show nowadays so its just myself sooo uh like i said were uh real small right now were uh maybe gonna look,0
um were just going to do what were do we dont rent trucks very often,0
yeah i mean ive im im not ever in the market to lease a truck,0
i might be in the market to you know if we have a truck break down rent a truck,0
uh actually friday afternoons not really a good time im sorry um is this in is this in regards to trying to do some truck uh rentals,0
yeah wweve ive already talked to people about that because we haul um steel coils you guys arent actually able to assist with some of our bigger needs with our semis um so its really not a partnership that would work unless we were able to uh you know to talk about being able to haul coils,0
um well i i have i guess the main thing is i have a truck i actually have two semis that we use from time to time we have a need for additional uh but penskes not been able to work with us in the past just not a a spot you know were situational um uh timing so thathats really the biggest obstacle that weve got right now,0
oh they they can but theyve theyve stopped by twice and weve not been able to come up with anything that works so you know i dont know if theyre gonna be able to do to do anything different than weve done in previous years,0
you may check with them and see if thats something that they can even you know that they can even do bbefore making an outside call um were pretty busy here and you know if theres an opportunity if you know if hauling coils is something we can do you know oon a situational basis there may be some opportunity but you know if not it really puts us in a spot where that service doesnt make sense for us,0
um yeah i mean we we we purchase new trucks every year um that that thats just something that uh you know we we just purchased a new facility in greenville south carolina so well need new equipment new vehicles there um you know but like i said uh dealing with that internally has been an easier option than trying to work with uh a service plan that does not include our semis,0
we are not ready uhhh we are not ready yet uhhhuhh just give me a call in a couple of months because were we still going through some stuff,0
well we dont know yet  i got to see whats all when we sit down then we can go from there just it would be on for another couple of months and well see whats going on okay,0
i mean what what do you what do you got i mean before i know if we can see if anybody would be interested what are you talking about,0
uh well as far as trucking i know wwere not interested in any trucks right now for sure i i i just had a meeting with our owner and were actually weve got a surplus of vehicles right now and were lookin at gettin rid of some because weve got too many um and then as far as services you know we only have like a couple of larger size two clearly larger sized trucks and ones a box truck and ones a flatbed and thats it you know as far as everything else its just pick up trucks so,0
no i dont think thatd be anything id be interested in but i i appreciate ya callin,0
yeah not right now weve got we had the we talked to you guys about uhh yeah switching over from rider everythings up in the air here right now so we do have a contact weve been dealing with so i told em id give them a call as soon as we uh get any information,0
if we could uh the last the last um week or two of february that would be great,0
i think i talked to him a while back we actually dont have rider um a couple couple years ago we squashed with star so we have about six years left on the contract and all of our tractors and trailers,0
we have nine at this location we have nine tractors umm and then we have four straight trucks,0
mm um well we really do very little going out almost everything we have is coming in so we we really dont use any trucking company only whats sent to us,0
no were not interested in in doing anything through uh through penske weve got our own company vehicles that weve purchased and and do it on our own,0
actually he ended up just buying box trucks so yeah were just not gonna lease em but thank you,0
yeah i wouldnt have time ummm you know we still just have the one straight truck if he wanna just through in some information ummm you know may be i dont know may be eight to sixteen months from now we might need to do something and at that time we would you know we would uhhh reach out to you folks,0
ummm and and give consideration to that versus uhhh you know purchasing you know trying to find a deal for lets say twenty five thirty grands something used ummm and then and then the truck we have now would be our back up so umm i mean i appreciate your time umm if he want to just put this in your file there it might be something required in eight to sixteen months and if that if that happen sooner uhhhh you know i uhhh the didiligence will include reaching out to you folks because we do want to look at it uhhh prior to making a decision  does that make sense,0
yeah but uh i i just i just be wasting your time on tuesday  i you know ill be brittlely honest so umm,0
but yeah just cacall me back in eight months if you havent heard from me shortly before you know,0
okay yeah i talked to him last year and i been tryna get my son uh  involved in that see ii i actually retired two years ago but uh i will reiterate this to him again and uh you know what year they are what what year the trucks are,0
nothin uh ya know i was interested in it i couldnt get my son interested in it but maybe i can now so why dont you give me a call next week and let me give you my cell phone number same area code and its twotwozero twentyfifty ananan actually hes in florida right now he wont be back until saturday and ill talk to him the first of the week and see if i can get him interested in it or at least hell sit down and and we can talk about it,0
actually do you have an uhh the ability to just send that via email cause im im actually really busy right now with uh internal work at the south so my time is is uh very very limited,0
sure be towards the end have towards the end of this month would perhaps be you know the best actually,0
no im not inter i i have i i need drivers i dont need trucks or tradein trucks i got thirty of them parked here i need truck drivers not different trucks thanks for calling though,0
well theres um my name is craig and then theres a greg but hes in another building hold of ts transit or,0
load and go okay this is load and go this is craig so go ahead,0
i dont remember ii talk to so many people in a day heh i dont keep track,0
hes been gone for about a year so its been a while then since youve been here,0
all weve got is owner ops nope all owner ops we got two company trucks that just pick up local loads and deliver local loads so thats it,0
could be hehe cuz we just dont have i know yeah i probably wouldnt be uh,0
thats no problem i just dont want to waste his time you know he could be out making a sale isntead of goofin around with us,0
well were pretty committed to our own fleet of vehicles at the present um well see well see what kind of growth we have this year to see if thats something you know we might consider ,0
i actually i want to know what you want to talk to me about anthony and ill tell you whether i have time or not,0
um that is news to me i did not know that any of the branches were leasing any trucks at all,0
okay um anthony im uh im gonna pass uh for now im not uh im not we have we have somebody all lined up that we handle all of our service for our delivery trucks through in measure okay so um yeah,0
um i this is uh like say this is news to me so you have a mobile truck that does service,0
im gonna stop ya im gonna stop ya right there we uh the the company that we purchased the vehicle through has been handling our service since since we bought it brand new and were gonna were gonna stick with them,0
uhhh a moment to talk uhh well im actually at another location oouhh what can i help you with,0
i tell you what uhhh i know were using salem right now uhhh but i can uhhh im trying to think i mean you welcome to to uhhh im thinking im not actually near for worth it all right now  im gonna say i mean you well you can email,0
i mean i can i can always call back at a time because im never really at the plants i tend to go back and forth  i have another business that i take care of and i deal with that like most of the time then i kinda do the pilot company kinda on the side i go but uhhh,0
uhhhh i mean we have a company that does it but i have guys that to run that but uhh i can uhhh i mean email it to me and ill ill show it to larry and uhhh,0
well go from there  i know that i know we have a contract now with with salem and i dont know when it expires i can go but i can get the latter and find out when it does and we can see what you what you got stuff like that,0
and then uhhh then we also got some trailers with them i think we we lease about fifteen trailers from salem,0
um uh actually todays not a great time but uh honestly uh ya know if this has to do with the uh leasing truck that we talked about a couple years ago or so um we we just dont have an interest at this point,0
oh we dont run our own trucks so we weve got a local guy that runs his own trucks and he does pretty much ninety percent of our deliveries for us,0
uhh were happy with the one we bought last year so i dont think were looking to upgrade or update right now,0
uhh we dont have any vehicles at this point in time and uh were not uh really looking for anything like that of that nature,0
coughs well im in charge of part of it but i know we aint upgrading no equipment or doing none of that so we were pretty much were pretty much a hundred percent owner operators,0
well its owneroperator they pretty much just take care of their self laughs its one good thing about having owneroperators,0
well i dont think so because by the time we go through all the headache of going and looking at other insurance carriers and submitting all the loft runs and tax returns and its just its never its never worth it so im really not interested in pricing it out,0
you know we we ummm we currently have uh three trucks in our fleet and ummm were probably not gonna look to do anything for couple of years,0
we actually have a guy that we hire who comes in and he reviews our maintenance schedule  he does all of our oil changes and transmissions clutches and all that so we have a loclocal mechanic,0
i think so ummm what happened was we discovered that one of our trucks ummm had the original uh air filter from nineteen ninety four still in it hahaa and uhhummumm another one of our trucks uhhh we dont think the oil had been changed since ummm around two thousand and fourteen so at least three years probably four years and uhhh so we have put them on uhhh pretty vigorous maintenance schedule every three four months he comes in and checks everything and checks our tires and make sure its all up and running we just pay him quarterly to do it,0
so i will encourage you to if you can you know to put us on call up may be in a year from now to see if were looking to buying some trucks or wherwhere were at,0
but literally just got one of our trucks back new vinyl siding and laddering and all that stuff on it and uhuhhh we also to do one of our pickups also,0
no no no cuz we dont need any we reach out when we do need one,0
you know what id love to say yeah but were pretty well set on trucks every once in a while well maybe lease not lease or or rent a truck occasionally we own all of our own trucks were all good and right now were not going to be in the in the market for anything in the near future,0
not right now no were good as a matter of fact um you probably know him jack gallagher ill call him every once in a while whem im lookin for like a used tandem or something that just come off of a lease,0
sure sure and hell turn me on to somebody to go talk to or whatever but usually yeah,0
so if we ever do need something because i think you guys are not too far from us,0
interest me is you you do buy uh trucks we have some older trucks that we are looking to sell,0
okay umm in terms of when you say new programs what are you speaking of in broad classification,0
yeah its going fine um no im pleased i i get short term lease uh packages you know where i ill coughs excuse me ill drive a tractor for three years um i have a an eighty thousand mile limit per year and uh and ive got uh currently right now we have five of them through rider,0
uh i am about a year and a half into it so im about halfway,0
oh it went fine yeah no problem i mean its uh uh initially i had started out with uh um sarah and umm and then and then i went to ccasey after that,0
yeah yeah and and i had uh id given casey a timeline so he he knows when to contact me when its time to you know um look at pricing and and consider other options to rider,0
no im gonna be uh gonna be off the following week so next next week is im gonna be busy getting ready and the weekend that busy yeah an option,0
you know what i dont right now im not interested in i got enough going already so i dont wanna waste your time and mine right now i dont have interest okay,0
no not unless i mean the only thing that im gonna give probably sell in the near future is an old truck that i dont use anymore but no,0
hahaauhhh im really not  i guess im trying to decide who i need you to talk to  i have got one guy that deals with the tractor trailers and another guy that deals with straight trucks then sprinters,0
okay uhhh it might be best if you wait and call me about a week from today uhhh weve got a meeting next week with a customer that would either create a need ummm for a couple of tractors or it would cause us to get couple uh were gonna two in anyway so its whether or not we replace them but there was no point talking until we have that meeting because if if it doesnt go well then we wouldnt be in the market,0
i would have to wait and see i mean i know im not going to change what im doing as far as i know my trucks and were just were kinda set,0
yeah were running like tracks and dump trucks so that really doesnt get into that where where you guys are at we weve gone this road before,0
uh im already working im already working with one of penskes reps out of pa,0
umm i can look it up i i cant remember im driving right now ,0
um it depends what who are you looking for like what dispatch accounting i dont know what youre look,0
oh we have our own shop and we dont do any leasing we just buy all of our equipment trailers everything,0
um rarely but whenever we do we actually do use penske weve probably um rented trucks from you all probably i dont know eight times before,0
need i just wouldnt want to waste that guys time you know what i mean,0
uh i dont know if theres much of a need at this point if you want to send me some information electronically for now we can review it to see what kind of programs youve got going on um i dont think were looking to make any changes i think the lease we have as is is fine um were not looking to add any trucks um at this point and i think the one truck that we have will work but why dont you send me the information electronically and me and a small group here can review that,0
yeah we got we got a penske truck so um yeah take a look at it and you you can yknow send me some information on whatever programs you have and we can review it and if if it does warrant a meeting then uh we can we can have you in,0
not looking to lease right now at all we havent leased for about ten years so,0
um no we dont even hardly ever have any of those issues so but i know that it happens with our fleet being so small,0
but ya we handle mostly everything in house or it gets shipped locally here somewhere to do work so,0
weve leased from you weve bought after the lease was up you know what i mean all that good stuff so we go we we put hardly any miles on our trucks twenty thousand miles thirty thousand a year i mean its real low so,0
what did todd tell him uh i spoke with him before he knows where i stand on it im not really interested in making any changes at this time,0
yeah actually um i called earlier because im having issues with uh someone about uh my billing and and their trying to go to collections and default and i talked to somebody earlier,0
yeah its gotta go above my rep and my district manager because theyre being uh unreasonable,0
uh right now i dont believe there in the market for a truck uh and i dont think that will be any in in in the near future umm ,0
for some reason no and i dont remember why i got something going on friday,0
ehmem i tell you what why dont you call me next monday and we could confirm that,0
we there for a while we were using you guys but we have purchased a new truck,0
so um the need for us to have them now is not very often it may be once or twice a year,0
no um and if anything changes theres a number i can reach you guys at,0
uhh no sir im not gonna be im not gonna be interested right in in doing any leasing or anything were were owning we own our tractors now were pretty well set in that moat but i appreciate your interest,0
i appreciate your like i said appreciate your interest in talking with me but at this time were were set pretty well with own owning our own stuff but uh keep in touch,0
no i think i no i think i think im fine um with just with just doing my regular renting out i really um we thought we were going to open up a trucking company uh a logistics company but uh it didnt didnt go through with my partner so,0
um i do but i mean were not you know interested in trucks i can tell you that,0
well actually im im not uh i im i shut the company down so im not so were not running any freight,0
thank you for choosing aarons this is joe what may we deliver to you today,0
uh actually our owner um decided that he wasnt interested in the lease programs and actually was purchasing new trucks instead,0
uhh we do everything just uh with the local shops that are here and just pay for them,0
right yeah when when we went over it with him last time cause i was the one who reached out to have somebody come in and give me some information on it um he decided he wasnt interested in neither one of them,0
mm i dont no i i dont think thats uh the way im headed right now but i appreciate it,0
umm not right now no we we dont want you were not you know we are okay right now uh maybe maybe next two months we might we might do something about um but right now we are okay,0
yeah yeah yeah i do i i uh i have a shop that do the maintenance for for the the trucks,0
because the the the lease uh its too expensive i can not afford it right now um,0
uh well the truth is im not really in the market for doing anymore leases right now i have three leased trucks and i just did my third one a few months ago so its going to be a while before im ready to do anything new ,0
you can always email me something you know i i was dealing with uh i think his name was aaron over there,0
um so yeah you guys should have my info youre welcome to just send me anything you want but i dont i dont see it as being productive to sit down and you know go over anything at this point,0
ummm at a time i dont know if thats necessary weve purchased van and well since we purchased since we rented from you always also purchased one of yours trucks,0
mmhmm okay all right well give me a number that i can call you back at,0
i do not think so  we are not going to consolidate our service because it is a lot of its local to local people actually as well,0
no no no no no  no but we have a lot of local cont little local mechanics that we do biz do business with so it is not all  we are not going to be consistent throughout  we are not going to have a one in all service program,0
i mean he could but we dont even i mean we just use pickup trucks for what we get were were kind of of a small one,0
uh i mean thatd be fine ive been talking with patton whos the i believe the manager of the local uh location here over the last couple of weeks so he has given me a proposal for for lease and and longerterm rentals but neither of those are really costeffective for what i need,0
well i have a uh a show i do in town once a month that i i rent a truck for uh a couple of days for and thats and then if i have any you know long distance deliveries i would rent a truck but thats pretty sporadic,0
i think he only gave me rental rates to be honest with ya i think he we looked at it and the lease was not uh,0
i mean just from doing the show here locally um uh we do like a hundred and fifty two hundred miles doing the show so its not its not that much um thats all known ahead and then its hard for me to predict what its going to be otherwise,0
well that would be okay other than we just got a truck from you guys um a couple months ago,0
no no as i said we just uh we got well we got one from you guys that i wanna say is three years ago we got in like an oheight and this year i think we got a thirteen if im not mistaken and we got that just in too and so we got those trucks and theyre theyre working fine so were all set,0
im not buying im not gonna buy nothing or lease nothing its all in house,0
umm uh what department are you guys coming from are you talking about the rental or the lease,0
uh at this time uh we are our fleet can uh fully stock uh loaded so i a lease doesnt look like its gonna be likely its just not it,0
um sputters ii guess it depends on what youre looking for how long a moment i have,0
um i we are good we have been down that road weve got a nasty case thereabouts from several people from sev and im not saying penske was one of them um but we are uh we are good on that front but thank you,0
mm probably no right now i mean youd have to call me you know i dont i youd probably have to call me on monday evening,0
yall have done some work for us in the past is that what youre saying and you anand what company are you with,0
i dont i dont recognize it uh what what do you what do you sell,0

uhh they have to take potluck do and my kinda bidness id be here one minute and be called out good just tell them to if it dont drop in or call to see if im here,0
we have purchased a used vehicle at this time and and actually have downsized the fleet significantly i do not see us pursuing a lease within the next twelve to eighteen months,0
appreciate the followup as always if there would be something that would we be changed we have your guyss contact information on file youre very courteous and astute with getting us the information that we needed for the lease and be happy if the if the situation would change to be in contact with you folks again,0
uh i think we did that before and its uh were were good though appreciate it,0
uhh you know man im im good right now im good i i appreciate it though,0
uhh yeah were not looking at doing that at the present time uh probably in the spring time its something well look at,0
um ill be honest with ya i i dont need any of your services right now um i know that you guys have called us a few other times but um we have access to so many trucks ourselves that um we have our own facility so theres not excuse me sorry theres nothing that um that i could use you for,0
uh not for for us uh  i mean all our locations have the same situation we have enough vehicles and uh spare vehicles parked along the fence and facilities to maintain em,0
uh just give me a few uh let me check my calendar can you send me an email and a girl will get in contact with you and well let you know,0
yeah man i really tell you i dont i just dont believe thatll work for us but most of my guys is owner operators i dont mean you know i just i dont even i i got five trucks and five trailers ive had for six seven years i mean you know what i mean,0
ive got a ive got a mechanic shop with a full time mechanic in there two full time mechanics yeah and i work on uh my owner operator stuff too,0
not right now uh because ill tell you why um theyre nice trucks ive done ive overhauled the motors and ive have them painted and re you know sorta refurbished and everything ill tell you why ive kept them old trucks is uh cause of e logs if its if its a ninety nine or model older truck and ive got ninety eight ninety nine model three seventy nine extended hood peterbilts and uh none of those trucks has e logs and thats why ive kept em,0
thats right and i dont really wanna deal with deal with all that you know what im saying,0
tell you what give me a call later in the week i mean see what my availability might me,0
uhh we just dont have any need for the trucks right now um we just have two at our existing storage facilities and we we own our own trucks so uh no matter how good the deals are we just we dont have a need for it right now,0
yeah yeah the trucks are in pretty good shape so its mostly just oil changes and stuff like tires here and there,0
umm no next couple weeks are pretty pretty darn busy and i know our we got our uh fleet we call him a category manager and our fort wayne indiana office its uh uh hes been discussing with someone so i think hes up to date on the programs,0
um shes not here today shes working from home is there um something i can help you with or you uh can send her an email she said too,0
um i i guess i could talk to you about that more or less if you need something,0
um i mean honestly not really at this time were just were doing all of our own stuff you know were motor rebuilds trans everything so uh,0
um bodywork we dont really have any bodywork if we do um it goes under insurance claims so that kinda just goes wherever it they tell us to i think we last time went to rendells,0
yeah i mean all of the mechanics side and fleet you know keeping up with oil changes and stuff that all gets done here,0
ummm well i dont know i think weve been just pretty lucky about that actually but um i mean ya know like i said i guess they probably would just have a blowout or somethin and um i dont know who they call then its probably ta or something or wherever wherever were around,0
okay um i mean i dont know if you wanna if you wanna call back and then um see when shes you know available and i know shes not here today like i said so if you wanted to talk with her when she is maybe call back tomorrow or something,0
im really not interested youre youre youre gonna talk about leasing and things like that,0
yeah well i deal locally with international dealer for my trucks uh and my service,0
um you may have the wrong number this is no john this is uh ivy acres,0
my name is james john you would be me yeah thats your john its james,0
well you know we really dont need any uh any of the services at this time we actually purchased a truck that were using as a backup right now so if any of our other trucks go offline were able to just use that as uh a backup truck so i yeah i think if uh if it comes to the point where i do need something ill definitely be in touch with you guys,0
okay great well i ive gotta run im a little late for a meeting but i appreciate the call,0
ummm well we dont um lease trucks very much um we we um have this ice and uh company that we subtract to that does all that but um ya know thought of us as an office furniture dealer and um so we sell office furniture i dont know any reason we would need to lease many trucks we ,0
we own um two trucks yeah that inaudibleone of them we uh new innovation or finely king ventilation bought it out and we basically rent it back to our installation company umm the other one yeah we own and uh we do have uh uh two of our own delivery guys that that drive that on it yeah yeah drride that every day,0
they all get serviced uh where we bought it but i dont know if um i dont even know if were allowed to go anywhere else but i guess i would have to check with our operations guy on that but uh i think we have a contract of some sort um i really dont think that would be able to take any time to sit down and talk to you right now anyway or we got uh too much goin on with taxes and stuff,0
we tried that and we have a a leasing company now thats working full tilt with us so i dont think anybody would be interested at the time you yup bye now,0
yeah ive got two vehicles literally coming uh in march so im good right now,0
no were leasing a hundred per a hundred percent but we still got a couple that you know we still use in our line but wwwere gonna wait until next year,0
um no i im not interested but uh you know if we ever get in a situation where we need you guys well call you in,0
uh probably not no i i dont think were gonna be interested in doing anything like that,0
um its kinda well to be honest were kind of up in the air on whether we gonna continue to uh lease out a truck,0
um uh actually we may be um not needing a tractor here in the next few months,0
we may need uh not a a not per say a truck we may need um like a yard dog,0
umm next week im im out of town week after next she can reach out to me week after next,0
i dont know that we have any needs for a truck in the near future but i appreciate your call,0
we we did a leasing with you so i believe hopefully that we will not going to have any needs for the any maintenance for may be a year or,0
better than more  so i believe ahhahhh i believe this could be fine for now right,0
uhhh i dont think were gonna do anything right right now at this point in time you might wanna check back maybe about uhhhuhh springtime will start coming about uh march something like it,0
maybe we have something you know we will need  you know i hate to waste you guys time came by here you know and were not gonna do anything at that time,0
yeah were not really wewe dont maintain any we dont keep any vehicles we just kind of change our vehicle from uhh box truck kind of vehicle to a truck and trailer so we arent uhh wewe really dont have a maintenance issue like we used too on large truck and then we already we we use you guys anytime we need of uhh truck type vehicle you guys are a go to source for that so,0
ththe sales call probably wouldnt benefit us or you any because we already love you and hahaa and so whewhen we do need truck we use them and uhh we arent maintaining a truck any longer so ummumm a bigger fish to fry than a small,0
yeah yeah weve already yeah ive already talked with the folks so we weve been in touch,0
yeah yeah i spoke to uh to to bob and um i cant remember the other folks name ,0
well yeah i mean he was just here i mean i dont need to see him again i know who he is where he is ill contact him if i need him,0
uh noe were not were just quite happy with our one truck and thats where were gonna stay,0
um actually so all of our all of our services cause we have so many different departments if i met with everybody that wants to come in and show us what they do i would never get anything done so what im what were doing if you can send me an email im gonna give ill uh send you the link were putting everything that were bidding out on planet bids any time were doing these sort of like service agreements maintenance agreements any of that kind of stuff its all going out on planet bids so if you send me your email i can send you the link and then you can register as one of our vendors so then when it goes out youll be um notified,0
right right so its like a fleet maintenance okay first of all we have our own internal fleet maintenance people here but occasionally theres something that happens where well you know itll go beyond the expertise of and in those cases we have like master service agreements with with  vendors we would put that out um out on planet bid and say were looking for an oncall maintenance um company that and we would give them the scope of the kinds of services that were looking for this is our equipment and then if its appropriate then you would be able to submit your i guess a fleet schedule and we would select like one or two vendors to sort of have on call,0
my email is a d as in david ehoyos as in sam at dur dot org so its a dehoyos at dur dot org my name is alicia,0
no actually weve been in contact um weve been dealing with trying to get out of a lease right now were actually sending were going to be sending one of the trucks back so weve been negotiating that ,0
uhh was it no no wait josh wwwhat i forgot who our sales rep is now i had his card here and now i dont know what i did with it yeah hes been in a couple times already,0
i was yeah i was actually it was actually a a lady um that was ,0
yep and we were we were in the process of doing something and then i never heard from her again,0
its two tractors and a rollback yeah my my my uh stick body i just send to a local shop here for oil changes and stuff like that,0
and he he my uh my local guy can actually do d and t inspections and stuff like that for the small trucks,0
well nate i am not interested at all in the big g side but we work with penske now and are all right with this and were very active with penske every day we dont like transportation like transport us its gonna cost more than penske now assisting years  so we are we are in constant communication with with uhhh penske,0
now on the big g side now there is no interest in sitting down having that meeting again we just had that meeting not long ago,0
uhh actually we downsize so umm i really dont use trucks anymore  most farm activities are struck with job to the job site now,0
oh you know i have kind of uhh settled in on actual buying rather than,0
yeah i i got that so so sorry you know i am i am just going to just stick the way i am doing it,0
uhh we never have had a program with you and we never have lease or even rented or anything like that and we dont plan to well,0
i tell you what i uhh i tell you we might better pass on this meeting this time like here because i dont see where i can help you and i dont know that you can help me at this point,0
yeah we do have everything all dialed and i got two different venders that handle all that for us,0
uhhh i ahh at this point i i wouldnt really have a need uhh may be check back in in another three four months,0
so i dont want to waste your time here but obviously whenever that time comes up well well get a hold on you guys and lets quote,0
you know that is a seven year deal i think we got about another year and half left on it i think,0
well uhh they uhmm i going to pay like aaa twenty two hundred a month uhmm,0
are these are these units that you are offering for sale for lease for rental what,0
uhh what what type of units that we are talking about  were talking about trucks trailers tractors,0
well i can tell you right now uhh i ill like to have you hold off for just a little bit if i can  we are right in the process of uhhh we actually have been working with greg williams,0
what we are doing is uhhh we have a pretty good understanding at what we need for equipment this year uhhh in regards to replacements for what is failingyeah okay,0
uhhh may be even looking at leasing new equipment and what he wanted me to do is go ahead and get all the pricing put together on new trailers and i have got four bids back now so i have a rough idea of what we want and if we if we go through penske to lease i i just needed to provide him with a capital number uhhh you know uhh retest that what we are looking at so the cost of it so i just got that in yesterday okay so ill ill be following back up with greg and let him know kind of ahmmuhh ourourour truck and tractor uhh needs right now arent great,0
but our trailers uhhh are we we basically need somewhere between twenty to thirty six trailers to replace though this year so uhhh the company has deferred that for a longtime so we need to take a really strong look at do we buy new do we buy used what they have been doing or do we lease uhh and i have got some analy good analysis work done uhhh and the the last part of that was we met with greg earlier this year,0
oh last year yeah last year thats right and him you know one of the things we were not real uhh excited about is that penske didnt have any type of the capital lease or or like a track lease where we can get the depreciation and secondly they werent willing to unbundle uhh werent willing to unbundle uhh the maintenance cost so i dont know if anything has changed but we we have at least three or four other uhh options and solutions to go with uhhh where they are very flexible and they offer unbundling all those types of services so so penske the last time we went through this and kind of analyze and got close,0
penske was the least attractive option and so unless anything is changing  its not that we wouldnt look at it again  its just unless anything else changes we dont want to be uhhh we dont want to be tied to your maintenance program and we we got the sales pitch on it,0
but be honest we we rented some trucks this last summer and fall and we got some of them tied up in your shop for two three weeks at a time and they were no substitutes or replacements and then we got billed for them even though they were in the shop and we had to get the billing reversed and everything in it and it didnt work like you guys claimed it would you know like if we are leasing and we have substitutes uhhh you know because the rentals we were saying well you know get us another truck and they said nothing is available and supposedly if we lease the substitutes that were guaranteed arent not you know its not guaranteed but promised uhhh arent there you know summer months are really really hot uhhh in southern california and and reefer trucks are hard to find so we ran into some issues operational issues with that with penske already so uhh all the claims that were made we didnt find them to be,0
service we have a full service shop and we have great relationships with femoral king directly and trailers suppliers we feel we can manage that a lot better than you guys can i know you are big operation i know youve got a lot of resources but be honest with you,0
just judging by the the rental uhh fleet and and getting that in and out of the local uhh shop for just maintenance it was uhh we had two to three weeks downtime for every vehicle no matter what it was in that,0
so so there is a little bit of a red flag there im telling you from a real life experience all standpoint versus what the claim was but we were happy to visit it again thats what i told greg  we are happy to visit again any ways but we are still going to kind of be asking for so that uhhh you know unbundling especially the maintenance uhhh services and that kind of things  we have got like a set of full service shop here plus our ceo its a big stickler for him  he is the money guy,0
and uhhh he wants to be able to get some kind of appreciation often even for leasing,0
so i plan on i plan on sending him an email uhhh probably early next week,0
and actually may be even by tomorrow to just trying to give him uhh an average number for what these trailers came back uhh if we buy them our specs and he just needs that number because he is working off of a capital amount you know i mean,0
i was going to give him that and give him a quantity and see because the quantity we are pulling around with now is twenty but it really we need to be closer to thirty six but uhh he can comeback and say hey here is where we can be and offer some difference solutions like may be may be five seven and ten year leases and you know whatever they wanted to do with the residuals uhhh is lots of things we can do we understand but at least kind to get something to compare to ryders then ryders got a product now  i am not not a big ryder fan i will be honest,0
aaahh  i had some i worked for a company in the past that spent twenty years now but the service was was really lacking and the cost of those lease we inherited from a company we acquired and we couldnt get out of those things and they were really expensive leases and the services wasnt great uhhh but now they have got a product where they unbundle everything and they have got different options for taking the capital depreciation and all that so,0
aaahh we are going to go to you guys and the ryder and uhhh you know there is a couple other leasing companies that we have align on that one our business that our just in leasing you know or financing,0
so were going to look at those as well but thththe penske product uhhh came out in the bottom uhh last time we went and did this whole round and we looked at about seven different solutions and it came right down at the bottom just because of limited uhhh limited options or you guys call them solutions you know,0
well you know costumer from a customer standpoint we want you to take the risk hahaha,0
but were were happy to look at it again and go the next round because we are probably looking at uhhh either buying some uhhh you know good number of new trailers uhhh or leasing,0
okay but i will be working directly with greg  i dont want to double up either so,0
what is that you are selling andor releasing is it is it internationals hinos or what,0
it varies honestly uhhh its its you know whatever is coming off of a rental fleet we just settle with that because we that was the other thing we noticed that we got stuck with the bunches of max force engines too and they are nightmare and they cost us we can tell you the exact amount of money it cost us in a period of time and we got zero help and support from international on that so we got stuck with them,0
and it cost us yearly so we are we are in the process of of uhh trying to you know to attrition recycle those things out of the fleet as quick as we possibly can which isnt soon enough so in the meantime you know we we made an engine change we made aaa we made a product we made a truck change and uhh we have been trying trying to purposely stay away form international and max force uhh so that kind it doesnt help us much either,0
we have our own we have our own service trucks  we have our own field mechanics  uhhh yeah we dont we try not to outsource anything,0
well nate i thank you very much for the call this morning  we do in our company have for all our facilities a full scale shop services and we do maintain all of our fleet inhouse,0
we typically service otr breakdowns either using our own inhouse staff or in the case of some emergencies well use uhhh michelle and b2b services etc,0
that sounds terrific  happy to have you follow up in the future perhaps will be more in the position or willing or desiring of the discussion at that time,0
actually i have not uhh i have not been doing anything in the uhh trucking  we were actually starting up uhh last year,0
and things did not go as planned so it it has been put on hold,0
not at this point umm but well definitely bring you guys in when its time for an rsq but at this point there is no rsq thats going out,0
it looks like next ten days is pretty pretty tied up  lets look it out maybe after the middle of february like after the twenty second,0
that will be in hayward if you want to stop by because we handle all of uhh operations on the hayward location,0
no its by appointment only so i need to find line at which time uhhh you know you can have him send by,0
yeah just send me an email so i can look up at my schedule and i can get back to you with my timings,0
nate we didnt get that government contract so we dont lease out vehicles on this time umm i would prefer if you know you guys dont contact me because there is nothing to discuss right,0
i appreciate you are following up but thats just its not really a good use of anyones time  hahahaha,0
yeah i do not  i am sorry but yeah we went with enterprise and uhh so we are good for next enterprise for next three years ,0
we currently are under lease with another company uhhh for the next six years so i dont think its  something we are gonna to be looking in doing anything with so i think,0
aaahhwe have bought two vans and so we are in good shape for a while,0
yeah i uhhh you know i do not use them anymore  i mean i used to use you guys but uhhh i have my own truck now so i do not use you guys anymore,0
one of my trucks need service so if you give me a number over there i will call and get a quote,0
well is it really a schedule maintenance program where they constantly calling me in uhh,0
want to uhh you know i take if i take it in uhhh no hahaa  i just do not use my truck enough i mean it sits for a couple of weeks at a time so,0
no you know we we bought a couple of new trucks we are in good shape,0
no they are new trucks we take them back to the dealer and when they,0
yeah listen i am i am not i have actually bought three trucks that you rent uhh,0
for your some promotional stuff that we had going on so i have got three large trucks and uhh back in about the middle of november,0
and we are just a construction fleet so we dont  really put many miles on a vehicle we just drop to a job site stay there all day and drive back,0
we are not we are not going to be in the market for anything uhhh probably this whole year but if we do it will be a replacement at the very end of the year so and i just hope like theres any need anything coming right now but i appreciate you are calling and reaching out  you are welcome to check back with me at the towards the end of the year okay,0
i think we are good right now  we are kind of restructuring everything here so i think were good,0
to still get a follow up in like six months or so you think that is better timeyeah that will be fine definitely check back then,0
uhhh i am just sitting grovers parking lot let me park my car very quick,0
i am doing good  i actually got an email from you guys there basically in it thanks but no thanks which came as a shock to hear from you,0
uhhh it might have been frables like a regional manager position i think he was reg rations manager,0
for leasing of car uhhh leasing of trucks that i had for my last job,0
uhhh  actually buddy i do not i do not work there anymore  i am i am actually looking for job right now  they did a restructure restructure the company and they limited much position and i would one of them,0
yeah thank you for calling  i thought you are calling from a crew site of hahaaah,0
no ashley  i am i am going to tell you that it is not something our company would uhh have any have any use for it  we have got all of our own all of our guys,0
yeah  we have got two here so and we have got i think uhhh seventy seven throughout the company so yeah,0
yeah uhhh i appreciate it but we would not be interested at this time but i appreciate you make to know us,0
well i think well you know thththe only time i really use the penske is is you know when our truck is down,0
you know that we call you guys and you help us out and we you know hire the truck for the afternoon or for you know a couple of days and that would really really be the only time you know that i would say okay  so is there any programs that are really different than what would apply for somebody like us to use this only a will call,0
only a couple of days  so i probably say it is not really you know one of those things where you know its every week or every month or something like that it is not that at all,0
you know you know when we have gone out to work with you guys we spent you know really nice relationships so you know we are happy for that,0
the reason the reason we used ricks which is just two doors down from us sixty six is because they are deal to inspect them so they they can do all of that work as well,0
versus going out and come in come out you guys and dropping the truck off and having someone you know follow on and picking them up or you know doing that just more convenient you know to go ahead and just go two doors down and have it done that way,0
but hey listen obviously if i was located at where you guys are located i use you all the time,0
well i mean it has been at least that but i mean it just not in our program at the moment we are not you know we are doing ,0
no  i mean were were good shape  we dont need to sell  i dont want to sell mmy i mean were just we are good,0
ahhhh i am i am not leasing any equipment if that is what you are calling about,0
uhhh what were doing is were in the process of hiring a new fleet manager here so what i suggest to do is you follow up in a about of a month and then we can uhhh may be put you in touch with someone who is gonna be thats thats job is gonna be the responsibility,0
yeah call me and then i can put you in touch with the the guy or the girl whoever is taking over the fleet,0
if it is the major work we would send to somewhere else but other than everything has done here in the shop,0
you know i appreciate the call but i am under impending sale so i would not be here that much longer,0
yeah whenever you guys uhhhh are available you can always only come in  uhhhh the important thing is to be able to speak to the owner who is not here very frequently ummm and i have to ask him if you know if he has been going to be leasing more trucks uhhh because i do not want t to waste your time nor my time either,0
uhmmm  i guess uhhhh give me a call if you want in a couple of days to check if i was able to talk to him and uhhhh and i well let you know we can schedule a time to to meet,0
i just want to make sure he is in the market for what you guys are offering i mean we are we have got services of ryder at the moment,0
yeah we turn some in mmmhmmm we turn some in uhhhh anyway yeah let me let me talk to the owner like i said i do not want to bring you guys out here or somebody out here and he and you know uhhhh and then tell you we are not really looking for anything so hahaa uhhh  phone or,0
right i think he can give me a call but lelet me let me ummm do you know anything about our company,0
mmmm is independently ummm we do not use the reyes fleet management so i guess what i am telling you is if we go with  anybody else it would be the reyes fleet management who does all our beer distributors all of our mcdonalds distributors all of our cocacola distributors,0
yoyoyou are talking about uhhh  i i i think you know what i i,0
and the meaning and so but we are we are kind of separate but you know mmm we are looking into going over to the reyes fleet management that,0
it is kind of an outside service that is is actually part of our company,0
you know uhhh if it were i think we got fifteenth largest independently own company in united states,0
ummm i was in about umm in the middle of something so its been so long to be a moment,0
uhhh probably not a good time now uhhh can we just like that uhhh later on uhhh probably some time in march,0
about the month from now and then well probably get together sit down and talk okay,0
we are pretty good  they are skilled set of mechanics so we are doing good,0
uhhhh if they are within range we will go get them ourselves ummm and then over the road they have got uhhh got a service uses them i am not sure who,0
i have already had that  i have actually had to cancel a contract that i had with ryder recently because ahh,0
it seemed to be little bit of a pain to them and i cant always get on you know on point with ththe scheduling and i know you guys are penalizers  we found the ryder has panelized for,0
we have contracts for dm services that havent been done in a timely manner so,0
just they you know just to help them and help myself i just went ahead and cancel it  i mean its great and everything like that and ryder is great,0
yeah so ahh you know i have i have heard a lot of different things about you guys and i know you guys are are great and your service is great and everything else like that but it just wasnt the proper fit for said our locations,0
ahh yes maam were just using a local we are using central truck and equipment repair so basically they can cover us across the board when it comes to our maintenance,0
uhhh probably the one you gonna need to talk is this about trucks and stuff like that,0
ahhhh and as far as maintenance right now weve got a deal with freightliner that works on our trucks,0
ahhh probably not right now we would  we we have just done a deal with the first of the year with freightliner on maintenance on our trucks so,0
you know the only trucks we have are just small uhh like three quarter ton vans and pickups  we dont have any heavy trucks,0
uhhhh no sir on those three quarter tons trucks and were good for a while,0
uhhh and i mean is there a specific scope with any scope of services that you just possible for,0
ummm you know could i mean can we look at may be sometime mid march i think would be a little bit better because i have a lot of projects going on right now i think it would be best to uhhh,0
uhhh you know i have to check internally just to see who is available on what day uhhh before i could tentatively set it up umm you know if you could give me ummm your contact information then i can look into and to give you a callback or email you back,0
uhhh no i actually do not sorry i am a little on the busy side  what what is about,0
no man we are good  we have already setup  we do not need penske  sorry buddy,0
uhhh okay  uhh you know i think uhhh this is more on a mind of what they are trying to do futuristically,0
yeah we are we are good in that  we had you guys in here a couple of years ago and it did not did not really pan out uhh,0
we are we are in pretty good shape running our own place right now so,0
i appreciate you checking in and as things can always change so you know you know you can check back again in six months or whatever but for now i do not waste your time or my at this point,0
ahh i think ahh i guess i mean there is there are host of things and triggers but i think the biggest thing is aaa the guys that came in here were ahhh set up to more handle over the road trucks and we really heavy hall and some very unique needs and it just seems like the programs and thethe vision and the ideas that penske had just did not translate well indarindoor heavyhall arena,0
aa not saying that might not be different now but we have basically gone through we had sold all our parts  we had got rid of mechanics and we had a start back up again so umm things are going well now and i am not really looking forward to get into ahh another avenue like that so ,0
naa no i mean at this point i got enough more things going and that is just not a pain point for me right now,0
all right  well i appreciate your call and have a good rest of the week,0
well you might umm you might as well save your time because right now we are in lease for another four years so,0
and you know it all reverts back with the same thing you know back when i was uhh when i was ordering the truck and may be you are just to order may be you do not back when i first started my business and we want to order truck  i i leased the truck through penske the whole time i was with bluebeckers and when i left there i started my own business i like penske and called you guys up to price out a truck for us and i had a quote back from ryder in three days and i was ready to order a truck  it took seven weeks to get one from penske and,0
you guys lost my account yeah hahaait is just where it is at i got to tell you ryder has been fantastic  i have had no issue so i seriously got all shopped around i mean you know when the time comes for a new truck we will you know required price possibly price you guys but ryder has been fantastic  i got i got no issues,0
i have given you probably call twice  i called twice during that for you guys and look what you guys own,0
you know unfortunately costing you guys the account but you know i mean i really have no i have no issues with ryder they treated us fair and pricing has not been bad so i am i am a kind of guy who is not broke i do not fix it so,0
ahh yeah yeah ahh i have spoken with you guys before  somebody else had called me a day before so,0
anthony we had already looked that in the past and they just did not work for us with our locations and everything like that  i appreciate it but it just it is not a good fit for us  we we we have been down this track before and talked with you guys and just for our locations and all everything it is not a good fit right now on that,0
i am sorry i just i i do not have the time ahh to talk on something like this  i apologize but i just,0
okay yeah were i mean were were in a seven year contract with them and were were not really looking to get new trucks at anypoint soon um if you want to check back in like a year we things may have changed by then but at this point it would just be a waste of time,0
and if youve really want you know steer to check check back in cause things do change you know maybe give me a year you know eighteen months something like that and and if you want to put it on the radar thatd be fine,0
no i mean i am pretty happy where we are getting our truck service and everything right now,0
well the only only reason we have made the lease one is if we had a truck down or something and right now we got about two spares,0
no i cant i cant afford your guyss rates man uh i cant afford much more than a two or three hundred dollar payment a month and the price you guys quoted me was just completely out of my lifetime budget i think,0
uhh yeah early enough on a monday morning but um does this by any chance have to do with vehicle leasing,0
iii i probably will not heres the skinny weve got a pretty comfortable relationship with both um aizuzu of north america and ford motor credit and um i dont think at this point we need to expand that horizon anymore so so i thank you for your time and i wish you a very productive week okay,0
so we are uhh im not looking to go ahead and uhhh get one now ummm it might start back up once some more projects are coming in but right now thats been put on hold,0
you can give me a call back in about six months  call me back in june,0
well lets try to get may be in month or so  right now im kinda tied up,0
ummmuh yes probably  i dont um im not in my office  i dont have my schedule in front of me ummm could i give you my email address and have you send me,0
thats the good one and i i think its uhuh highes who ive spoken within the past using the portland office and im not sure it would be the person im meeting up with  he left me a message a while back too so i can even reach out to him,0
well not not just real soon here but our owner actually passed away we we are actually in in the process of reorganizing the company  the other family members are taking over but its just been a couple of weeks here so ummm things are a little topsyturvy and uhhh theyre just reorganizing under a different corporate structure and that kind of things so right now,0
honestly i would say probably something like may or june would be a little bit better  our our need is not immediate i know there is some construction time on the vehicles that we would be looking for for leasing but ummm like i said probably wont make any types of uhhh purchases uhhh you know in the next couple of months after do one thing,0
if you would  yeah ive got your folder on my desk here to i just uhh we hope to do something after the first of year and then unfortunately its unfortunate circumstances here and so,0
yeah uhhh i tell you what uhhh yeah lets wait a couple of weeks because im really really busy next two to three weeks you give me about a month and call back and ill ill take the time to look at it,0
oh okay well ththis is my cell phone number i think you you may have got it uh crossed over with kyles but uh i may be able to help you whats going on,0
uhh probably not i mean weve been scattered all over most of the uh eastern uh europe here um so im not sure if anything can really wide enough to set up an appointment maybe you can have your sales rep come out and then uh uh and well be here but uh iif you want i can give you an email address and you can shoot over whatever information,0
okay mmy email is david david at uh eps thats e as in edward p as in paul s as in sam dot solar solar,0
no this is fine i think what happened was it just probably got forwarded through the um the the call center here sometimes it forwards over if somebody else is on the other line so,0
that could probably take us an hour to get the truck down there so um definitely not interested and and i every time we need to have a truck serviced i dont want to drive it through town to get down to you so until you guys get something on the north side i wont even be entertaining the the thought,0
okay maybe uh could they send me an email first cause i dont want to waste their time i just want to see what they have to offer and ill tell them yeah this looks good or no it doesnt look good because were doing okay right now as far as our fleet management goes,0
yeah but we cutting we just resigned up our our new lease with the uh um our new uh whos the new lease people now used to be um yeah we we just signed a new lease with someone so we wouldnt be able to participate,0
um whats it regarding because we weve got our own driver pool so were not interested in dedicated driver services and weve got our own shop ,0
yeah i i dont think were interested like like i said we weve got our own own driver pools already and here were doin it,0
no but wwweve looked at it in the past we weve got our own investment into our shop and services and everything and were going to stay that way,0
tell ya we just we just have the one truck and uh were just happy we just get it serviced uh yeah a couple times a year and we dont run it a whole lot and uh yeah it really doesnt uh i mean we didnt have any complaints with penske when we were with them but uh really just cant justify all the cost for none more than we run the truck,0
no right we just do our own deliveries here and it may not go out but once a week for a couple hours or so,0
thank you for calling habitat for humanity this is amy how can i help you,0
yeah probably we just got a new truck um so at this time were kind of not really um needing any assistance with anything like that but yeah you could call back at another time,0
um i dont really have time to talk right now would you like my email address you could shoot me an email maybe,0
um we wont be needing any im weve already taken care of that for this year,0
well uh at the moment i have no authorization to do anything uh weve been sold to a new company and hadnt really met the new owners yet,0
yeah and like i said ive only met with the guys a couple of times and just hadnt got anything set in stone on what way were gonna go,0
i i said i i purchased a truck uh last summer so i actually i now own my own truck so i got im not right now,0
uh nate i appreciate what youre doing and i know its hard work not a lot offun but were not interested thanks,0
well we dont really have a  need for a truck right now or the budget for one i should say,0
no were sort of were we we just we just got a uh new new truck through a grant last year and uh you know so so the uh unfortunately replacing our other truck isnt really an option right now um but i appreciate your reaching out and uh if you wanted to you know schedule out you know reach back out in a year or so maybe well be in a different situation,0
well one of em you know one of ems fully covered uh through the through the grants they have no norepair cost and uh um really we we partner with a with a a a dealership in town that provides everything at about a ninety percent discount so its a you know its we its weve very minimal very minimal costs on that um so its not that i dont appreciate what you guys are offering but uh i know its not going to be a you know productive use of anyones time unfortunately so,0
i mean actually we take care of the maintinence ourselves and uh were actually not available to purchase any trucks at this point,0
that um thats fine but i mean i mean were not were not in the were not were not available to purchase or do any purchasing at this point,0
um you know what um tuesday would be good but uh think hed have time to review some of it over the phone tomorrow,0
ummm i just dont have a good sense of my schedule yet so id hate to put some anything down on there,0
please dont feel free to give scott my number and tell him to feel free to call because ah definitely ininterested in seeing what the new programs id be uh do you have um a good insight to some of the details rough rough details on on your new programs for twenty seventeen,0
you know for now were not interested and we just we just done the last truck with penske so i dont think we wanna do anything with penske at this stage right now and we were customer of yours for ten years so sigh ,0
weve just sent no no its just costwise  no no i mean it just doesnt make sense for us,0
nope nope nope let me speak uh your uh at this point the penskes run thirteen feet one or theirteen feet in height uh typically is what weve uh what weve you know when we were renting from you guys on a daily basis you know all the trucks we got from you were thirteen feet or more um we we never could get a lower truck height so that prohibits us from getting through the uh the lincoln tunnel so we ordered we ordered a custom units um that and leased it for three years um out of a new jersey based um uh leasing company and weve been enjoying it now since uh i think july or sometime in july when we received tthe units and its a two thousand seventeen and its really were really exited about it so were real happy with it,0
yeah its its iit pays for itself and we dont have additional business should we get larger though thats a different story and then wed be on the on the market for another one,0
nope we maintain them i go to west palm beach and i go to jupiter ,0
yup i got a body man here and me and one of my other guys are engine builders and transmission builders,0
um i i would say we would but you know the truck that we have is um well weve gone the full use of a third party uh provider so uh theres really no um no vehicle here of any substance to to put into a program,0
yeah you know  i know how it goes but no we are not right now i mean i have got like another trucks they dont want to do that fleet service thing is somewhat what i yeah,0
um i mean i dont know if ill be around but i i mean as far as knowing about i i know right now that im not doing enough that im gonna try and lease a truck or anything i appreciate you callin but uh i i mean ill be honest with ya id be wasting your time and my time both because um no more no more we got goin on we got two old trucks that are one of thems paid for and one of them nearly is when i had talked to yall id talked about hiring a driver to pull a trailer full time and uh i got eh i ended up throwing that trailer instead of putting a truck under it and the only trucking we do is our own personal little stuff so uh i just i mean id be id be wasting your time to you know to do it because i know im not gonna you know see ooour in the near future i dont see me you know doing anything right now,0
um im actually may im going to uh a meeting here at nine thirty wwhat chu got on your mind,0
weh let me ask are you you talkin about uh leasing trucks and things of that nature,0
right okay okay you know uh in that situation we uh we maintain our own trucks we have our own shop and uh we maintain our own uh uh own call uh you know dispatch and well go out to the road and then uh we actually own all of our vehicles so thats been the philosophy of the you know its a privately owned company its been that philosophy for uh you know about fifty years is to own our fleet so im really you know not interested in any kind of uh any kind of lease or any kind of roadside service or maintenance ,0
uh you know our warranty work we we take back to the manufacturers and and they perform that um we we do actually do major um overhauls and uh and um inframe type rebuilding in the engines um you know i guess the two things that we body work we we dont do and uh transmissions we dont do,0
um you know im really really not interested because we we have uh you thosethings kind of set up where we have vendors that we use and uh you know i just dont wanna waste your time or mind either because were not interested at this time in changing,0
yeah they they i mean they are in here on monday through saturday or whatever andlike this and most of the equipment is out here you know its out and its back or whatever so,0
like i said we always got trailers rolling back in and out so now do a good job,0
then like i said if its uhh engine work or whatever most time it is covered under warranty because weve got aaa the built five seventy nines,0
um you know joe the thing of it is were a capital acquisition company and we dont uh we dont use any leasing or anything like that everything we we do we acquire and uh kinda run a good program like that so uh he can stop in and and give it to me but uh you know uh i dont want to waste anybodys time either joe,0
hey where where is he going to land head office is in bloody helmont im in edmonton quite regularly too i can meet him there,0
okay tell tell you what why dont you just have him reach out to me directly on this number and uh he and i can coordinate meeting ill be up in edmonton some time,0
uhhhh two international box trucks a hino box a hino box truck uhh gmc pickup ,0
the one other international i think is ofive and the hino is i think twelve or thirteen,0
as ryan ryan runs a lot of the umm as far as doing the maintenance on the trucks as far as running back and forth,0
uhhhmm i dont know if im going aa i have a pickup here that i might replace within days but like i havent decided yet,0
here ill be honest with you i got a three by shop and im the only mechanic so,0
we probably had six bigger trucks but no were not real big coop but no here and,0
were just were a small shop and we dont get into that kind of stuff so,0
no  im walking between two building right now  some girl just hold me in her office,0
ummm my extension is two fourteen but im going to be slammed until next monday or tuesday if you can call me then,0
uhhhumm no im kind of busy  is is this ummm about a rental that we have or,0
ummm actually im just about to go into a meeting umm can we can you check in with us at another time,0
yeah yeah so what i would like to do is i have i have someone who is going to take pick this up again soon and hell take the lead on it,0
if you can uhhh if you send me a uhhhh emal then i can forward that on to that individual and he can get back to you,0
yeah because we got screwed big time on the contract the last time and my boss will fire me if he walk on the property,0
i mean i am i just sign a longterm lease with with uhhh paclease for a uhhh little dump truck that theyre building for us,0
no because that thats something that was just uhh especially truck we had a build for us,0
okay okay  ummm sure now and youll have uhhhh and were talking about our heavy duty commercial vehicles right,0
well you know what i have ummm at first i always try to keep them out of the shop,0
ill have anyone ummm but just send us some information we love to look at it because we  it might help us out when uhh if we ever need to rent one,0
we have a two thousand seven volvo tractor  we have two thousand and uhh lets see hold on we have forty nine we have two thousand international forty waa foury nine hundred,0
and we have ummm the two thousand seven volvo and of course a ninety six international,0
ummm i think were good for now  we we have a longterm lease and im not looking for any other options at this point other than a possible rental,0
you know we have talked to uhhh to umm i guess both penske and ryder but yeah we are not looking to leasing anything or purchasing anything this year  uhhhhh we may add something next year but uhh we decided to actually purchase vehicles over leasing uhhh we bought you we have an onsite mechanic of the thing so  they do all our maintenance  i understand you guys offer that as well as well as ryder,0
right but you know what we do is aaa just basically rent from you guys thats thats the only thing we might try to do that for now,0
yeah  you know i think our local rep i cant tell you his name right now,0
yeah and so we had this discussion and i think well yeah were probably at this point we got a pretty new facility uhhh in the last three and half four years and,0
he is in a meeting right now but uhhh yeah he can he can uhh schedule an appointment with brian,0
no no were not going to do full service lease and i didnt talk to you about that  and then and uhh i already have i already have good maintenance system in place so,0
lets yeah we are only were and we were in some options with you guys but uhhh but you know what kinda spot you got,0
ill probably buy ill probably buy two three units this year and i probably wont need major repair so,0
so i mean right now it wouldnt be a good time to you know we will probably be accomplishing things,0
uhh this doesnt thing seem  yeah yeah okay i will ill give you a call and uhh if if anything changes well give you a call  well give you first opportunity okay,0
i can honestly tell you i am damn the only three drivers so i really dont think we are interested in anything at this time,0
uhhhmmm you know what right now i think i am going to pass  we have got a lot of things on our plate  i think we aregoing to pass i want to pass right now  call me back may be in a month or so,0
uh probably im im i think we are fine  i mean we dont we dont use to do any rentals or or anything like that so,0
uhhh ill be honest with you im a im a real small company and ive been in the business for a longtime and we dont advertise and just everything is running smooth for me so i really appreciate it,0
yeah we arent we arent adding any vehicles to our fleet in two thousand and seventeen and the ones we are adding were purchasing so,0
we are not considering we are not considering any uhh lease fields at this point,0
so you thought that we have bought uhhh you know trucks for our business and we dont need leasing anymore,0
yeah yeah we have uhh company on beaupit highway that that maimaintain our trucks and uhh we we appreciate your call,0
well i think we are already in the process of getting setup with you guys for rental on our trucks,0
well uhhh donna is our person who is kind of head overall the trucks and rentals and stuff like that but we buy our trucks  we dont lease any of them,0
okay  see uhh were good with that the problem we have got is our forklifts dont really put those many hours so just that contract and the trucks dont put those many miles on them so we guys do it on as needed basis first,0
okay tell me what its about first whats it regarding that youre saying our vehicles,0
uh yeah but we really dont have per say a company vehicle i do have i mean uh some of our company vehicles but its not itss not like its um i mean i cant remember the last time we actually had to deliver anything we have installers that actually take things out so its not like we have a company vehicle that gets used on a regular basis for the company,0
no they i mean they have all their own and most of the time its their personal vehicle i mean but they use it for work and that kinda thing so,0
uhhh well let me check because uhhh jose is gonna be out of town this week and next week,0

we have three service trucks one of which is an addon fuel truck has a tank on it very very long holes its a ,0
you know umm there has been times because i have more trailers than i have trucks,0
umm and i uhh there has been like once or twice i have rented from like the local international dealership and they were real close and i deal with them all the time,0
its like thirteen o one west patrick uhh complex over there i know where theyre at,0
