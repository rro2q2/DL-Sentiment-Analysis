__label__1 we we used to we used to deal with you guys down in a while
__label__1 well uhh youre correct uhhhhh we do own most of our equipment uhhhhh and uhhh rather little bit complicated weve got a uhhh colossal help company of course that uhhh we lease it from
__label__1 and then also too we hired two mechanics that take care of our equipment sitting here uhh roughly uhhh i dont know about two million uhuh dollars worth of those stuff weve looked at leasing uhhh in the past uhhh id welcome a conversation uhhh with someone that would may be highlights some of the advantages of leasing but uhh i ive done this in the past uhhhhh not avail but again you know im not going to close the door may be i can some some light can be shine on some uh things that i havent heard that before
__label__1 yeah they have given me several uhhhuhh messages before and ive kind of tossed it around and i understand theyre theyre other bigger players so if anybody has anything to do teach me it might be all
__label__1 trucks about two hundred thousand dollars im trying to buy and thats kind of a decision im trying to run through right now which direction i want to go with
__label__1 yeah pretty yeah anytime really works were were always here if he wants to like schedule and make that

__label__1 okay i have him so matts kinda hearing this the same way as you are because i havent really talked to him about this but uhhh but i thought i might be uhh more talking about to see if we could have a company like penske take care of those those areas but thats thats good to know that you do have ummm so so you you come out umm in the middle of the night or you come out in the daytime or which whats the maintenance truck would be coming you know hahaaa yeah maybe thats the conversation for when you guys come out here but uhhh matt he was asking if he could come out the week of the fifteenth for half hour or an hour or something like that
__label__1 i dont know who i dont know who i talked to it has been it has been a while
__label__1 okay well i should say i never hurt the crowd yeah ummm yeah any of those days tuesday wednesday or thursday just let me know and uhhh ill make sure im available
__label__1 uhh phoenix uhh we got one in reno uhhh its actually its outside of reno but its reno branch but its actually in uhh carson city over there ummm

__label__1 yeah uh let me check i know today is pretty booked up and so as tomorrow ummmtutututuu thursday is somewhat open ummm may be he come in in the afternoon ummm after one may be so anytime after one between one and four
__label__1 uhhh we we were handling our own uhhh we dont have a vender in here at all
__label__1 yeah it would be uhhh but uhmmmm my shop manager is uhh he is out right now
__label__1 uhhh he had uhhh he had a medical issue so uhhh maybe maybe next month
__label__0 give me uhh at you know at what the terms would be and then the milage rate
__label__0 no actually i dont even have an interest in uhhh any leased vehicle or anything im pretty much set with uhhh my rolling stock right now my units
__label__0 well were actually umm actually preparing uhhh an rft to look at uhh an rft to look at uhh lease lease maintenance versus uhhh own and do our own maintenance so uhh i would wait for that to come out first before we do this
__label__0 ii think were probably not interested in this we have some of our own mechanics and then we have umm
__label__0 some other local shops that do our work and i i assume thats kinda where we wan na stay for now
__label__0 uhhh im im good right now i dont want theythey will be wasting their time but uhhh right now im good thank you anyhow
__label__0 ummm you know the best thing is to be in contact and make an appointment
__label__0 well im im not in the market for that right now im im im trying to get back into market for it but right now
__label__0 im just simply not in the market were kinda kinda on hold the owners are kinda on hold with that so
__label__0 yeah yeah yeah if we get if i get where where i think i can do something yeah i would love to get david back in here and uhh and get some quotes from you guys on on another unit aa but at the moment now there would be just simply no need i think
__label__0 because the owners uhh yeah the owners they are just not not interested right now
__label__0 im at the mome im im after a moment on a weekly basis so you know until until they show some interest uhhh there is you know the only thing i can do is keep my compliance coming in on a regular basis to them and see see what happens but if they get interested in anything ill be sure to give you guys a call
__label__0 uhhh thursday wouldnt work why you dont have him call me on monday and well try to arrange a meeting
__label__0 yeah wer were all set with with all that stuff we were were not interested
__label__0 is the local yeah so so i actually talked to him not not that long ago we we talked from time to time uhh so so we dont we dont necessarily have a sales need right now we are we are getting some uhh uhh full uhh service lease units up here that were going to put down in the in the twin cities
__label__0 uhhh but so you know we we we we will have that need down there but uhh but specifically uhhh for new units we dont we dont have a need right now but uhh but scott and i do talk uhh couple times a year
__label__0 yeah no uhhh you know we have uhh we have four techs uhh and uhhh and a shop manger here that take care of all of our our units uhhh here other than what well be using uhhh in uhh in minneapolis with those full services leases so were were good here and and most of our other locations uhh other than other than loveland colorado have uhh heb shops as well and you guys are already doing the the leases in uhh in loveland anyway
__label__0 yeah we do yup so our our shop takes care of that and and then we have a national account with michelin who takes care of our uhhh roadside tire things too so
__label__0 um im just im just not interested i we own everything work on it here uh i rent a little bit of what i dont have and thats as far as i need to go with it
__label__0 no that thats okay i mean i try to do business here locally uh i put roofs on their business i pave their parking lots i do crane work forem so were go around
__label__0 were really not interested we are not doing any leasing right now we have got everything uhh pretty much under control with some uhh good working capital so uhhh it would would be a waste of time okay
__label__0 ummhmm okay yeah i think weve been in discussion with kevin and uhhh we were looking towards actually putting a a national contract in place and some of we agreed upon fedex rates etc but apart from that i believe there have there has been no engagement in terms of any other projects as such uhhh so you know from time to time we do have some ad hoc project requirements for example temperature control etc but i dont think penskes really been engaged uhh from that perspective and i dont know what youd recommend in terms of actually engaging umm this penske local folk in terms of a response for ad hoc projects
__label__0 ummm i think next couple of weeks would be a little challenging actually but then yeah definitely i mean there have been discussions in terms of you know just engaging penske in terms of uhhh a national nonexclusive of course national contract umm so i believe based on you know how those discussions progress we would then look for them coming out and having discussions with us but i guess at this point of time i would say we should just keep that on hold but wewewe do get their we do get their at attention whenever we need it so were good for now
__label__0 yeah might be int interested in that i got some umm tractors that are coming up next this year so but ummm next week uhhhh its a little bit premature right now were only into monday hahahhaha so i think ummm if he wants to send me uhhh couple of dates then ill look at my calendar
__label__0 uhhhh whats his name i have uhhh we have a rep coming at site in knoxville
__label__0 no umm probably better if you just send me his info and may be i can talk to him over the phone
__label__0 yeah we dont have any power of our own and we usually only rent if uhh drivers uhh truck goes down involved in an accident or something like that
__label__0 oh i got there is a shop i mean i can go and rocking hit a shop right behind us
__label__0 uhh truck diesel repair and they give us excellent deals because were right in front of them were in the same we share the same parking lot
__label__0 no that we dont need it we dont need the local rep to stop by uhhh weve purchased uhh we just bought a new truck last year
__label__0 that would probably be be a waste of your time at this point because were currently under contract with ryder
__label__0 well we have our own we have our own fleet here at our location in birmingham but with our eight satellite locations we lease all our
__label__0 probably not right now umm we just uhh we got a new maintenance contract or something like that uhhh with uhmm or we or we did it with para transit were continuing the same uhh on the same lines on what we were before the only overflow that we that we have is uhhh is going through ford right now ummm because there are all ford vehicles and um so we just umm made a contract with them so right now we wouldnt be doing anything umm so but ummm i appreciate youre reaching out though
__label__0 ummm the expan the expansion that we have done ummm is hasnt been uhhh exactly what we thought it would be uhhh and the we have expanded it with another program out in sunrise area but there were using fords for that uhh right now umm its just so happens theyre right across the street so the thing worked out just perfectly umm so right now we wouldnt be looking at anything i mean extra
__label__0 okay well were we got a fullservice garages we got two garages that take care of missouri
__label__0 okay uh im actually officed out of tulsa but i am also this week on my way to kansas city and then to st louis this week so where would you wan na i mean what would be the most convenient for you i mean as far as
__label__0 it would be r roberts one the number one at bbu boy boy umbrella mail mail dot com
__label__0 uh no actually im fixing breakfast with my family its not even uh eight oclock
__label__0 okay well this is this is my home number and actually its a little early to be calling people anthony
__label__0 anyway you could just send me an email and let me get with you on that
__label__0 really cuz really and truly right now michelle i im down to one truck still got two trucks but hell ah right now im down to one running one truck right now uh but im definitely looking at doing something
__label__0 yeah we um we we totally i know weve rented from you guys in the past but they but we we have our we built our fleet up now where we dont we totally wont need any rentals or or lease vehicles in the in the near future
__label__0 mmm id i dont know i mean we we rent from you guys and i dont know if you can check your history but we we rent uhhh multiple times which is like a van or a cargo van or something
__label__0 im kinda bent plus i went home early yesterday umm get over something im sick but uhh i dont know i mean why whats whats is he just going to go over rates
__label__0 well i mean we we have so we actually have a uhhh uhhh i mean we we rent from you guys but we have a full fulltime lease actually with ryder that we had for uhhh a little over a year and half actually
__label__0 so eveeveeven though we have it with them that doesnt keep me from you know rent from whoever we wan na rent from whatever is convenient wherever so
__label__0 uhhh uhh i mean i if if if you got deals going on or something i if you just want to email it to me and ill in that way i can print it out and put it on my board here
__label__0 so always have it uhhh that would that would work for me i dont necessarily see the purpose of a meeting since i already rent from you guys haahaa
__label__0 yeah about a year and half or so i think then may be two years
__label__0 oh yeah its uhh it was four brand new truck built to our built to our uhh needs
__label__0 you know i think you must have the wrong number umm my name is happens to be john as well possibly wewewe do we were leasing from penske but we bought a truck from you guys
__label__0 are are with harinam harinam and yeah i mean im im over in oklahoma right now so
__label__0 yeah yeah it has gotten six hundred thousand miles on it right now and we bought with five sixty so the last fortyforty thousand have been great i mean ive had a few little hiccups but nothing bad at all and now well be looking at getting more soon uhuaa you said you guys had a promotion going on right now tell me more about it
__label__0 right well well you know i think we were we had nineteen fifty with us and thirteen cents a mile nineteen fifty a month and thirteen cents a mile i thought we we are running umm
__label__0 with two year lease yeah whawhat it hohow much more competitive are you guys getting now
__label__0 you know i could could could need a truck by next month you know honestly if i was gon na you know branch out i was just planning on it but if theres opportunity you know comes by knocking so
__label__0 okay perfect perfect all right john hey i appreciate ill well we are gon na reach back out to you shortly okaythank you sir take care
__label__0 yeah but im im im pretty good right now uhh i dont need to be re imprinted or nothing
__label__0 uh um yeah i mean we talk um would you like to let me know you know what is going on um but if its in regards to new business i will say that we are locked in with ryder
__label__0 i mean i mean you can and you know i appreciate the interest but you know quite time for you its gon na
__label__0 its going to be probably waste your time because you know we we are contractually locked in with them and um
__label__0 and for the yeah the small fleet of the truck that we have gets taking care by a number of local shops and dealerships
__label__0 ummmm i think we have had in the the few years there have been here for a while so
__label__0 in prior years weve had a few different entities look at fleet maintenance and fleet service and even leasing and such and that hasnt just never has panned out for us
__label__0 yeah its like i said this is since we are such a small agency and then you know limited number of larger pieces of equipment and certainly you see penske all over the place but usually the independent locale at the center in lager entities or metropolitan water districts or you know
__label__0 yeah why dont you go and email me what you have and then ill ill pass it on
__label__0 go ahead and email me what you can and ill and ill forward it of to them
__label__0 yeah ive never had anything from penske they keep calling and everything and and i never used penske because i always buy my trucks outright
__label__0 oh yeah im im i am just at a stop light right now so go ahead
__label__0 what happened since uhh pretty much our last clear communication a year ago we we have now decided uhh to purchase rather than to lease
__label__0 so we purchase uh a truck uhh a new truck and uhh at least now it will you know and i guess it was just uh our financial man decided that because we intend to have it for long term and everything like that that that was the best thing for us to do
__label__0 thats just what happened uh the only thing now yeah weve weve branded some uhh trucks haha so weve done that but uh beyond that yeah were not going to be looking for any kind of long term leases any time soon so where we are
__label__0 well yeah right now because you know its under warranty uhh wewe take it while we are in town then i can we take it up to appleton where we purchased it and for service uh because uhh i dont know we took enough there we just feel its better for at least during the uhh uhhh during the warranty time anyhow so
__label__0 so you know thats right after the warrantys off uhh it will be whole different uhh situation i think you know
__label__0 good question uh i am not sure if its a one year or three year warranty yeah its mileage related but we never we dont drive enough miles so uhh it will be time thing more than anything else i think its uhh like uhh three years or so weve had it uhh we havent even had it a year yet so
__label__0 we wouldnt wan na swear that it is three years because uhh i knew all a lot when we when we were buying and comparing it and everything else with you know diesel versus gas and we found out that you know diesel is not for us and so that type of the things so uh that was one of the things so uhh that was it so
__label__0 yeah we would be interested in that uh one particularly uh well i dont know wowo as i think its a big dark shake up wewe had a scratch on uhh on uh the box of the truck and uhh so we ended up having to taken up there and so we had to rent one of your trucks for a week deal hah or three or four days while they repaired it and uhh so obviously once the and you know just because they thought they would do a better job not that it was warranty or anything else but uhuh we are at we just thought that was a better thing to do so uh so we were bought up for three or four days but i think thats the only other time and then normally what we do is uh uh we are taking it up there for service during the warranty just to you know not have problem telling why you know they didnt do this right you know so
__label__0 uh were taking it back to veer a moment you know until the warranty is off and i dont know whether its a one year or three year to be honest i knew it when we bought it because i negotiated it
__label__0 so anyhow i think thats where we are now when the warranty is off its a its a whole different ball game were were gon na wan na do it locally or at the lowest lowest cost and well
__label__0 well next week is uhhhh a bad well actually this month is a bad lit month uh sometime you know in the future i guess ill have to look into that see what kind of warranty we have on it because if its if its a three year warranty its not much use i am talking about it now you know
__label__0 and uh and it seems to me it is but uhh and it is um its also a milage thing and i know we wont hit the milage because we only drive a five to six thousand miles a year probably sooyeah just lock on thats why we didnt go to diesel and a lot of other things it basically ended up that its the only truck that we could really uh use you know haha uh
__label__0 and if uh because we after finding out that diesel would be a terrible decision for us uh for it starts and stop and cold and all that happens so
__label__0 week after or next uh next week and lot lots of meetings and negotiations and the following week im gone if so thats why i said i dont come back until the end of march uhh i dont know so
__label__0 you know i think sometime anytime after first of april thing should slow down a little bit so lets see what happens
__label__0 yeah he can give me a call then and in the meantime ill try and look up and see uhh you know if we have a three year warranty and i mean if it is im not going to discuss service from the end and i mean may be two years from now or we would well see what happens okay
__label__0 um im having a meeting with jeff neal at ten oclock next tuesday i believe
__label__0 prior and jeff looks like mike prior and and jeff neal are going to be here at ten oclock on tuesday
