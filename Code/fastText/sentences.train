__label__1 uh you wwelcome to stop in but let me uh make you aware that you know we have our own trucks so the only time i would need anything from penske is if i have a truck down and uh i just need to to rent one for a day or so
__label__1 uhh yes sir uh yeah that that would be fine uh just just cant be extensive but
__label__1 um im actually gettin ready to leave out right now um uh i id rather meet yall at yall office if uh you know this something this to discuss like that
__label__1 i can yeah i can uh schedule a time to uh meet with yall next weekend next week excuse me
__label__1 is is any special time yall want me there or is he gon contact me
__label__1 no uh not not at this time i mean i were just going through a bad time right now

__label__1 no no not at all hes a general tool store i am specifically entertainment and studio rental business nothing to do with the general tool business
__label__1 we we we both we both use fleet works because theyre local and ive been doing business with them forever
__label__1 umm yeah let me look at my calendar real quick and you know im looking at chicagos right
__label__1 and yeah we have all of our dollies and everything in house so we never really rent that uh i think we probably i know last year we were exploring uh leasing options but i dont think that thats my guess or were not were probably not going to do a big fat move
__label__1 but yeah i can talk to ohh what was whats his name whats my reps name again
__label__1 yep uh yeah i can talk to phil again i think i mean like to be honest with you were pretty quiet right now but it never hurts to have you know a
__label__1 i think we may have discussed this before what we found in looking at leasing a vehicle was um we have to have huge savings if were renting it because we have to uh pay an additional insurance policy um i dont know if you know much if you have thought about that with your customers like um i think were getting away with murder on that one um we rented a truck a twenty four foot moving truck box truck uh lift gate um every day of the every day of the year last year um and theyre like you guys are crazy why if youre going to use it that much why not uh you know a couple year lease and uh youll pay about half the rate we got the proposal from them this is back when i was talking to you about it too and were like its not half the rate its sixty five percent or whatever and we talked to our insurance carrier and theyre like you have rental coverage but you dont have coverage on that vehicle if you lease it itd be another seven or eight grand a year and were like there goes the savings huh so were of a mindset of we dont wan na quote on quote lease one because wed have to you know let them know hey were using this thing every day versus now were doing it and nobody seems to care we even told them we were
__label__1 um thats fine i mean ii just kinda like you do probably blow and go with the wind in terms with what people need um so i dont want to say ill be here on a thursday when some customer may say can you come to kinnesol on thursday so you know have derek uh reach out to me if you want and um im usually here about eighty percent of the time

__label__1 uhhhh you know what if he can come in tomorrow like ahhh early afternoon between may be noon and two

__label__1 we the odds of us having to rent a truck are pretty rare i am not saying it would not happen
__label__1 you know we have only got like two hundreds trucks no i am kidding weve only got no so i am not saying it could never happen i wouldnt mind if even if someone just email me something i would try to keep it but
__label__1 we we just run two trucks the odds of us having to rent a truck
__label__1 i am not saying it is never going to happen i think it happened once in fifteen years when we have may be both our trucks broke down or some but its
__label__1 yeah i dont want i dont want like to say i am in sales so i understand but i dont want to waste anybodys time because you know
__label__1 so you guys are so you are talking the services is what you are saying
__label__1 oh that will be we are talking february fourth yeah yeah that will be fine if he wants to breeze in uhhh tuesday february fourteenth
__label__1 yeah i guess that will be fine uhhh i would have him call me first uhh we have a meeting between the general manager and a couple of salesmen this next week
__label__1 i know it could be monday or tuesday i am just not sure exactly that day but
__label__1 so far uhh yeah but just like i said just have him call beforehand before he comes may be an hour or two
__label__1 that ififif i know in advance i will just change it or send you an email
__label__1 okay well the older units are not my problem its my new trucks that are the problem
__label__1 the leasing company trucks are all those the nonsense all the new stuff the ammations the areaha the after treatment the d p f all of that shit
__label__1 i am i i am leaving here in probably 20 minutes and i may not be back until saturday so
__label__1 uhhhhhhhh you can check with me next week i dont know at this point yeah
__label__1 uhhhhhhh yeah we can probably tentatively set some up for may be the twenty third about ten oclock
__label__1 what day because i will be out of the office but if i am not here thethere will be there will be a guard only here so i i will be here monday and tuesday after that i will be gone
__label__1 ifif he is coming your rep is coming on that day i would like to talk to him
__label__1 because mostly yeah i do not see and he would be coming at elabouck right
__label__1 yayeah because there is one there who was up there i think was bruce i do not know if he still there or not
__label__1 yeah i know yeah may be tomorrow at ten oclock no but on tuesday at ten oclock
__label__1 well itititit that number has changed back it is one zero six industrial it started at oneosix industrial then they changed it to twotwothreeo
__label__1 coz aah rdo and then they went back after it got consolidate in with c
__label__1 ummhmmm well we i am pretty wrapped up next week uhh you go and push it out another week
__label__1 let me ask you let me ask you a quick question because this be yes or no if i have time if uhhh if we say we say we need lease trucks from you guys is on a fixed monthly deal or is it payments or monthly payment plus milage
__label__1 well you could you could come out to a yard and talk to me and two of my brothers that are in business with me we could just test things what is your rate let me ask you a question what is your rate per hour and uhhh maintenance
__label__1 uhhh most of them are freightliners but mine are all different i have a volvo kenworth and international my brotherinlaws have freightliners five freightliners and one international
__label__1 yeah i would i would get together with a maintenance package right now because outside maintenance is eating our lunch i mean not going to give high thinking about that it is eating our lunch
__label__1 uhhhh if i knew that we have two thousand they have two thousand and twelve freightliners with with cummins eating our lunch
__label__1 we do not want we are not going to buy anything cummins again we have been i have been very very uhhh loyal to cummins my entire carrier of
__label__1 we we are using dealers for the most part and it is just eating our lunch
__label__1 hundred bucks uhh we we pay at one shop hundred and twelve bucks but mostly we get eight five bucks an hour where we go
__label__1 yeah you have to be below eighty five dollars an hour for us to to want a change for what we are dealing because
__label__1 even though uhhh i am i began to work away from dealers and going back to smaller shops that are only fifteen dollar or fifty dollars an hour
__label__1 uhhh you get you know that is a whole lot easier to swallow than eight five right now
__label__1 okay you could come well if you did morning it is better for us yes like a day the morning between nine thirty and eleven because after that we have way too much stuff going on
__label__1 okay yeah we would like to uhhh have we would like to be able to know what we want to get rid of our trucks they are just it is no and i think i would rather be able to take all of that uhhh my taxes
__label__1 i get my brother we have a lot of money tied up in our trucks but if we could trade off our trucks as down payments to uhhh be able to get lease trucks were they are new maintenance is lower everything is lower plus you can take the lease off of your taxes every year
__label__1 naaaahh i think the one that reach him was israel so let me transfer to him and see he can schedule something with you
__label__1 so yyou offer maintenance programs programs for trucks ahhh that will be cool yeah i would like hear it
__label__1 okay yeah you know what next week will be good time ahhh after ten am ahh if you want to do it on lets say wednesday
__label__1 that would be fine yeah because im to be out of town i believe on thursday friday thursday friday i will be out of town
__label__1 thats okay no i just i am just kind of curious to see how you guys are gathering information because this is my personal cellphone and i really give out my personal cellphone out so it must be somewhere haahaahaa
__label__1 no sir never i really dont i am not interested in rental but i am kind of interested to see what you guys offer for maintenance
__label__1 and then rentals may be may be just to see what you guys will charge for for for uhh you know a refrigerate trailer that that might be the only thing
__label__1 and if he could if he could and if he can bring scales of like what is the even averages or something that shows what you guys are leasing your fifty three foot refrigerate trailer like a breakdown thatll be great because i would i would love im actually looking at trying to sell my equipment and then lease just that i can do as a tax write off
__label__1 right now i have fifteen i have fifteen trailers and i have ahh twelve tractors but if he wants to also bring what if you would charge to lease a tractor that would be also great to give me a breakdown of everything that they fill it as two thousand dollars you guys have two thousand fifteen or two thousand fourteen whatever your figure is
__label__1 if you can bring me somsome prices i know its not going to be you know all this is what what we can potentially lease of you just may be like ahh like a market like an average and you know what we could potentially negotiate on this or you know you know i mean just like we have a gauge
__label__1 aaahh not too better you know hold on one second just give me one second
__label__1 next week i could probably talk to him depending on what its all about yeah i think i can fillfit him in
__label__1 ahh yeah its probably let me just check my calendar here really quick lets see what i got next week todays is fourteenth yeah probably tuesday works
__label__1 and who are you are you the appointment maker or youll be with the rep
__label__1 will you also put your contact information down there in case world comes to an end and i need to rearrange things
__label__1 maintenance we usually ahhh we well we have they are dependent on this one of our bigger trucks or vans
__label__1 aaaamm we have ahhh i am trying to remember the name its an old pal of ours
__label__1 i think thats and we have a minivan i am sorry there is a chrysler minivan
__label__1 yeah let me look at my calendar here maybe aaa actually maybe the week of the thirteenth
__label__1 aahhh tatatatataataa national update meeting could we do could we do ten thirty to eleven
__label__1 what is next thursday second uhh yes i dont let me check my calendar umm i have a meeting scheduled at nine am a staff meeting uh but that shouldnt last but about an hour um so i should be available either before eight or after ten
__label__1 umm well might be do you know if we have an account with penske now
__label__1 well um we probably wouldnt be interested in maintenance or lease right now but we did i believe set up a rental uh account case we needed to rent a truck cause occasionoccasionally we need to rent a truck for a short term
__label__1 who would i talk to to find out if we actually have an account now
__label__1 we just uh yeah it happens we we just find the repair shops that are available and send them there
__label__1 would that be uh only if we had some maintenance agreement thing with you or
__label__1 uh yeah yeah should be able to yeah thatd be fine this is for truck rental and stuff like that
__label__1 uh email would be its mswartz at arnt arnt asphalt and then a co like company dot com
__label__1 uh probably sometime in the next couple weeks im going to be in houston next a week and a half so sometime after that
__label__1 my name is holly wallace and then uh email is hollywallace two seven like twentyseven the number at yahoo
__label__1 yeah stop him out you know weve got were loaded up on units right now really but
__label__1 ummm let me look here yeah i am not shown anything sometimes fridays can get a little dicey but uhhh that should work uhhhaa
__label__1 i dont want to talk to him i used to work for penske six months ago
__label__1 hahahaa yeah you can you can send him in and he can try to convince me
__label__1 she she does she did she did something around your uhhh your fleet side scheduling maintenance or something recently took a job i believe on the purchasing or procurement side her last her married name is gajewski
__label__1 but its its a combination of you know of of wine trucks bucket trucks con and then and then a fleet of a pretty substantial fleet of light duty pickup trucks so coloradosf one fifties that kind of stuff
__label__1 yeah one fifty probably but the kinda like i say its a you know probprobably by the time they throw buckets and
__label__1 yeah yeah yeah we have four five mechanics that do a lot of the basic repairs state inspections that kind of stuff yeah
__label__1 uhhh the bigger stuff gets sent out we we have a relationship with uhh if its on the if its on the equipment side of the vehicle most of our stuff is altec
__label__1 so so goes to an altec shop and there are couple of those down in this area
__label__1 and then if its if its a cab chassis thing i aa you know im not sure i know theyve got a lot of internationals over there
__label__1 aaa so so it probably goes through probably goes through that depending upon you know warranty and all that
__label__1 aaa but that seems to be thursday and monday mornings seemed to be the ones
__label__1 and and so they may they may already know each other or there may already be a story and an answer there everybody save every running steves name by him and if that conversation has already happened there is no sense
__label__1 and again yes steve would have the perspective of you know what do we buy what we you know so what we buy what we lease
__label__1 yeah that that kind of you know here because i i im pretty sure we buy the big stuff
__label__1 i am pretty sure we buy the big stuff and lease the small stuff but thats just a level of detail i havent gotten to but anyway so so steve would id have steve join us so his history or his files you know relating to steve or or conversations would probably be helpful ahead of the you know ahead of the
__label__1 yeah i am i am so i i i am thevise president in charge of a a bunch of corporate services one of which is fleet and procurement and warehousing and all that kind of stuff but steve is one of the yeah
__label__1 aaa you know what ive never emailed him from the outside i can hahahahhah iii email him from the from the inside all the see if i can figure out how to look and what see what his uhhh figure out what his internal email is its one of those things no body asks you yeah s
__label__1 fifteen isnt good fourteen isnt good no id id right now probably right now the best day for me would be wednesday the eighth
__label__1 were were well actually you know yeah were i am in manassas so were were
__label__1 next week is not good we have got three people off soshould be all right
__label__1 yeah and aa definitely interested in it we have three trucks uhhh two sixteen footers and a twenty four footer
__label__1 umm the two sixteen footers are about a year and half old we bought them brand new from gmc
__label__1 yeah were were about were only about six miles away from the previous location just more retail oriented space and all
__label__1 after one o clock or or friday friday anytime after eleven o clock is fine
__label__1 we take it aaa we take it where we bought it from aah we bought it from miller ford and they have a pm package so we need take it to them they do all the dot inspections all that stuff
__label__1 uh monday and tuesday are going to be crazy busy days is that you think that you can do wednesday thursday or friday
__label__1 umm im not sure i have got an appointment outside of the office at nine so there is a good chance i wouldnt be here by ten

__label__1 yeah just tell him to give me a call before he comes because im im in and out
__label__1 yes maam we uhhh weve done this before and it doesnt work out but
__label__1 were poultry company we have to do our own maintenance were in the middle of nowhere where you still be going
__label__1 our corporate office is in is in alabama but my office is at in bay springs mississippi
__label__1 next next week would be good because ill be ill be in my office next week
__label__1 yeah look and and i wouldnt mind seeing keith at all the issue ive always had is the uhh the security deposit
__label__1 so thats the one thing that has been holding me back is uhh having to pay the security deposit but uhhh but if we can and i know at one point they were talking about trying to figure out how to may be wave that for me since ive been with you guys for a few years
__label__1 so thats one of the things thatd be important to me so but i dont mind talking to keith at all but uhhh but thatll be one of the sticking points okay
__label__1 yeah you know itll be you know moh youll meet my brothers uhhh hold on minute please okay
__label__1 im sorry about that my brother yeah you can stop in here to be meeting my brother i in the office and well if my brother takes care with the truck and maintenance more than me you know sorry
__label__1 uhhh yeah i dont foresee i should be here you know he wouldve i wouldve done on my calendar best thing to do may be call who is ever going to stop in may be give us a shout uhh monday just as a reminder you know
__label__1 could be yeah which all i have to do would be to have the keys to the trucks
__label__1 ummmummm yeah i wanted to look at them but i i actually have kinda like a little local mechanic
__label__1 uhh theuhhh the problem is i am like the only guy in the office right now
__label__1 okay well i dont know if any gaps that we have we have umm our own maintenance people our own mechanics umm so
__label__1 not looking to sell anything we just umm we just bought uhhh couple of new trucks and i think were okay on those
__label__1 the only thing we get outsourced is if we have an issue that requires the computer to be hooked up to it uhhh thats the only time but we dont have the specialized equipment for ummm you know diagnosing a computer issue
__label__1 ummm well tell me exexactly what that is uhh when ummm do you have all the analyzers for all of the different models of trucks
__label__1 okay all right well i dont mind the guy coming in ummm he might it might be better if he just talks to our mechanic and sees in that way if there is any gaps he would know about them
__label__1 uhhh lets see yeah i would uhhmm id say tuesday would probably be the best day next week to meet
__label__1 uhh also and when you say that this is for the new units can you give me both of them
__label__1 yeah you can have him stop in but we do all of our own work and stuff like that too so
__label__1 uhhh its hard to say every day is different for me and stuff like that so
__label__1 but i mean he can come in but you know if you never know what happens you know ten minutes now i could be doing something else too thats the thing so
__label__1 one phone call so yeah just have him give a shout and just drop in
__label__1 yeah tell him one oclock uhhh i usually leave off if im if im in the office i leave by three
__label__1 yeah im just getting ready to walk into the building here but yeah sir good morning nate
__label__1 yeah lets uhh i wouldnt mind sitting down listening to some go for next week
__label__1 uhhhhh that should be fine uhhh lets go bit more lets do uhhhhhhhhh like eleven oclock something like that
__label__1 have her call me this is my cell and because my days change all the time so uhhh she can shoot me an email but itd be nice to have her just follow up with the phone call in case i dont catch the email its unsureill have her meet uhhh i have my dad in the office there as well ummm thats the only reason were in the process of moving from six fifty five down to sipe road ummm and ill give her that address when i know the number of it uhhh its only its one exit down so uhhh so we will sort that up and then umm its on the maintenance side of things right more or less having you guys help with some maintenance yeah i would like to lease things but ummm id like to talk to her about some numbers but i run all daytime single runs for fedex so i could just never make the numbers work you know the payments are too high with the uhhhhhohh with the extra ummm maintenance or whatever it is you know the five cents or or and i couldnt i just cant ummm think up the paying right yeah its always three four thousand dollars a month something like but ill sit and talk to her for a second okay
__label__1 oh boy hahahhaha its hard to say i i never know where im going to be im in ohio right now
__label__1 if he call if he calls me ill give him direction on where i can meet him
__label__1 uhhhhhh i like to probably do it lets see let me look at the calendar today is uhh six i can probably do it uhhh eleventh i think i got tenth
__label__1 yeah sure you know my problem is is giving the appointment time is tough service calls is tough ummm if he is in the area he wants to give me a call and say hey im ten minutes away could i stop in thats the best way to do it
__label__1 good question huh well actually you guys are little late because weve already weve already renewed not renewed we chose a different vender but weve already solved that
__label__1 no i dont know if theyre really truly a competitor of yours or not uhhh oh i guess they are because theyve provided us with the equipment we needed but uhh its met metro truck leasing
__label__1 yeah and you know mostly if theyre kinda right extra where we are up there and we about a year ago we got a sample vehicle from them as a umm replacement for one of ours as it was wearing out just to see how the relationship would pan out and what not and weve been very successful with it so decided just kinda try and take it to the next level on the additional vehicles and probably not two months ago we finalized our deal with them
__label__1 uhhhhhumm west vigo which is new orleans is coming up on and well of course its its its two thousand eighteen but you know
__label__1 yeah yeah its a five year deal you know well start looking probably mid next year for well yeah mid next year for some sort of a solution
__label__1 well no ill take that back ill take that back lease expiring one fifteen of eighteen so thats
__label__1 yeah sure i mean i dont want to rule out any any possibilities you know we did we we im not assuming that anybodys gon na get me what i want at the rate that i want
__label__1 anymore we traditionally were doing all of our business through ideal leasing and we we got into uhuhuhuh you know both parties probably have some responsibility but primarily they didnt meet our expectations on a deal that we had it went south and they did the last man pull the plug on an agreement we had so we had to file three vehicles that was a brutal haha which we we we dont really want to do that so sure enough of all things our customer decided theyre gon na operate their business differently a year later so now were stuck with three seventy thousand dollar over the road tractors with no home for them hahaha and uhhh you know during the whole transition period where we went from leasing and having service and everything to having to purchase them they had clearly communicated to us and they have an in service situation these were at uhh united rentals all of them yeah and as they brought them back in they would completely go through them and they did not
__label__1 so when they delivered to us one of them was in high point and it was high point industrial and it it was done uhhh iit looked great on the exterior but come to find out the regeneration systems and the filters and everything
__label__1 that that that thats uhh ideal lease was supposed to look at and review and replace before they put the rugs and put trucks out for sale they didnt do any of that so cost was almost twenty thousand dollars a vehicle
__label__1 it was very painful and its even worse now because we are sitting on all three of them and nothing to do with them so yuyuyou know but i mean we even asked them hey throw us a bone just you know i mean and you know you know weve bought them out like for you sure you made a bunch of money on the deal because they are already come off lease
__label__1 and uhh you know nothing so we uhh we we dont do business with them bu in may be two out of the fifteenlocat sixteen locations we have anymore and and we wont be doing business with them on those as soon as the lease would expire so but yeah are you talking about somebody thats based in raleigh or where would this person be
__label__1 wwell let me explained something to you not that im not willing but let bygones be bygones but i wont be doing any deals with him
__label__1 uhhh and i would be happy to work with penske uhhh given that theyre all things being equal but it wont be with watt
__label__1 i owned my own big distribution company at one time and we probably had ummm tentwelve trucks with the with them
__label__1 uhhh and things as i changed my business model and tried to work with them on turning some different vehicles and renewals and various different things and it got really ugly and watt was at the center of all that decided to part ways permanently you know hahahahha im just telling you like it is
__label__1 yeah i think there is a guy and i was just looking at this the other day ummm i want to say his name is joe he is up in the north raleigh locate yeah and iactui actually sat down with him and i gave him our spread sheet of locations and expiration dates and everything
__label__1 well i work out of my home so im not in an office per se i would i would make an appointment with them and i would probably go up there and just discuss various different things to them i mean we were probably a few dollars away from doing then that mount holly deal with the ryder folks and uhh theyre still maintaining those big units that i already talked to you about we have a maintenance agreement with them and we are going to put those back in service pretty soon so uhhh you know we are not opposed to doing doing that that stuff but we ended up in there in mount holly they were jockey you know yards switcher trucks
__label__1 yeah so we ended up going with left one for the maintenance fees was ea better and easier for us plus they had rentals on site you know in case you had a catastrophic breakdown of some sort you know thats where ryder kinda lost out so im not opposed to working penske ryder metro
__label__1 well the week after next would be better because next week im actually supposed to sit down with the insurance company and we are going through all the list and and i have to do a bunch of preliminary work do agreements and stuff and i need to stay on top of this
__label__1 yeah no there is no need we do all of our maintenance ourselves and and if we do partner with anybody has be through a contract
__label__1 uhhhhh currently i have well i got 20 vehicles in total but uhhhh had some issues with my straight trucks i got maintenance issues costs are getting
__label__1 uhhh i bought a cash to used but i i have two trucks down and im renting 26foot straight trucks right now
__label__1 next week is our annual meeting and so its going to be a very busy week uhhh were getting prepared for that so it might be better the week after may be or
__label__1 uhhh no i dont im pretty tied up right now im about to have a meeting in about couple minutes
__label__1 uhhh yeah why dont you just go and email me and i reply to you uhhh about the time i have available
__label__1 it doesnt matter just just i know ragin tell him tell him to give me a call whenever he is in the area
__label__1 uhhhhhhmmm let me think a minute uhhh far as i know babetter check back with me on monday because i dont know if driver dont show up i got ta get the truck and go
__label__1 no no no all would be that im interested in is buying a used truck if you got one the used twenty six footer
__label__1 yeah yeah were at the same place we do most of our leasing through uhhh enterprise and uhhh there is unfortunately there uhhh theyre more price their pricing is better than yours plus they are much closer closer
__label__1 yeah and and you guys have been right here before the run i have no problems you guys good at trucks im renting trucks for you before but what i need is uhh im trying to get away from the leasing trucks anyway so thats why im looking for thats why i want a twenty six footer uhhh thats why im looking for another truck ive got two trucks with me and im im looking for another one right now

__label__1 no used to be but then kids could send out uhh not a take over but uhh
__label__1 i guess you say consolidate yeah consolidate to mcarthur is now calling thats actually the corporate office now
__label__1 ummm it was based on lets say here who who who who that branch dealt with
__label__1 and then uhh they gave uhhh the corporate office and start repeating all down what should be improved
__label__1 the things along that line if we were happy if everything is going good and then ummm they would give us a load and break it down and say okay youre gon na be dealing with so and so and so and so so
__label__1 ummm right now its a combination ummm we do own couple of tractors straight aa trailers straight truck ummm so im not exactly sure if we are going to go full out own or we are going to mixed it up a little and then im not a hundred percent sure this just started happening since don retired

__label__1 i believe i talked to bob quite a few months back i told him that id have to check with certainly my brother uhhh
__label__1 and i dont know exactly i think he was trying to talk to me about lease program but im afraid it would be uhh waste of your time because my brother who is the accountant has basically told me that we are not going to do any leasing so
__label__1 i have got one of my main managers off on thursday and friday so can you do it before that
__label__1 uhhh well i guess i do but uhh we dont need any trucks right now

__label__1 lets see uhhhh next week uhhhhh looks like may be uhhhhh probably can do it on the uhhhh looks like may be monday tuesday or wednesday the twenty sixth fourth fifth and sixth any of those days works
__label__1 its usually in the afternoon after lunch or or like morning if the if the earliest we dont need i dont usually schedule anything till after ten thirty
__label__1 if you want to uhhh you want to shoot me an email or anything and something comes up i can get back with you if something happens
__label__1 yeah i mean i have got i think eight of my eleven trucks come due in february
__label__1 we did do a six seven year deal with muskeralla in the nineties worst human being in the history of human beings lied through his teeth on everything i swear on fifty bibles i would never do business with penske again to see we just uh and i have been with uhhh inland paclease ever since i have been with them for like sixteen years and uhh i mean you can send the penske rep in
__label__1 but uhhhuhhhh i just i had a horrible experience with penske you sound very young and you probably wouldnt be even there twenty years ago or whatever
__label__1 it was everthe trucks were garbage everything about them fell apart the full maintenance lease was a crap uhhh he left for me to die me to death and uhhh just wont return phone calls didnt work you know and uhhh im a grinder you know i have been in business for thirty eight years were not a big company were were not i mean we got eleven trucks you know but uhhh bottom line is you intrigue your worst enemy i mean it was he came in here and just gave the greatest little proposal uhh presentation ever because were buying our trucks you know and uhhh he had a little competitive to ours but a friendly competitor uhhh kilmer wagner wise in garden grove and he had just cut a deal with greg wise uhhh you know for five six trucks and you know and what a great deal it was but well and i can not tell you how bad our deal was it had nothing to do what were paying per month and everything it was just penske didnt keep the trucks up uhhh trucks were down all the time the rentals that we were supposed to you know the replacement trucks were never available and like our trucks are twenty six foot box and uhhh he he was putting down a fourteen footer haha you know and uhh trophy that lasted like two hours you know and never an apology and uhhh just worst company to do business with ever ever so but if you guys it has been like sixteen years so or may be the longer may be twenty years but if you guys have gotten better and muskeralla is no longer part of the program
__label__1 yeah i might even be able to go back in my old records from the nineties and literally tell him exactly in detail what penske did to me records and it was not good
__label__1 yeah every every if we you know uh i mean when i i do my own contracts and uh every i and every t is dotted i mean there is i having done this for thirty eight years i can pretty much foresee any possible you know uhhh situation happening and i want it in writing what the company is going to do
__label__1 ummmm have him have him email me because i dont know if im going to be uhhh here in the office next week
__label__1 im probably traveling so uhhh have him send me an email and then i could give him my uhhhuhhh i guess my schedule uhhh probably we could we could schedule something probably not for next week though uhhh
__label__1 so probably when i get back we could for sure uhhh i could uhhh schedule with him i guess he could he could stop by and show me that no problem but uhhh
__label__1 but its gon na its gon na to be probably by the end of the month okay
__label__0 so yeah i mean iim pretty much uh free in the afternoons after one thirty
__label__0 no were good we when we when we need a truck we we come to you guys come down to see you guys
__label__0 im good thanks im good im iive got it taken care of here locally thanks
__label__0 uhh what do you need why you im kind of busy what all you really need im not leasing no trucks or renting no trucks right now or nothing so
__label__0 nah i we weve got this guy weve been using for about fifteen or twenty years and i wouldnt switch for nothing in the world
__label__0 oh okay uhh well i dont do anything you know i dont i dont lease any trucks or anything i dont rent any truck i got my own
__label__0 uhh ive got extra i mean ive ive only got one driver and i got three trucks so
__label__0 okay now if you want to check back in with me later if anything changes thatd be great
__label__0 uhhhh im not really looking to lease anything right now probably not interested umm towards like this the third quarter of this year
__label__0 uh i i do some myself so i i have a lot of lease equipment so they do their own
__label__0 uh i dont know i dont know because i just got some and uh i just changed my fleet around
__label__0 itll be itll be itll be out there somewhere probably ryder because thats where i got them from
__label__0 uh really not at this time because of what ive just done so i mean im in the process of doing it right now and
__label__0 no you know we havent simply because aand and god bless penske but uh hes a competitor you know he hes taking work away from the companies that i do business with and its hard to support your competitor
__label__0 well we do all i mean we will rent a truck when were short but you know penske comes in and logistics and they and they bid on these runs theyre taking drivers they have the trucks they have the resources god bless em i dont but its taking work away from me and ryder just took business away from one of my one of my customers and uh you know its hard to support aand uh no offense
__label__0 no we do the the smaller stuff the oil changes tires grease job the bigger stuff goes over to our shop right around the corner from us and hes really done fantastic with me
__label__0 yeah we have our own techs and weve got you know other um garages that we work pretty closely with theyre able to turn the vehicles around for us pretty quickly
__label__0 yeah everything i mean literally uh so um weve even gone back to uh uh whats his face uh docat on a couple of engines of theirs um yeah theyre right in the area i mean theyre literally right around the block from where my boss lives so
__label__0 oh gotcha no actually uh i think were set though cuz we uh we use the um the old gm um um we use the fleet um gm fleet
__label__0 yeah uh for the most part uh were um our uh our entire um region over here were using the the fleet
__label__0 yeah just this pc we have uh we have two service trucks we have a um uh stick bed uh f four fifty and a boom truck
__label__0 you know what joe i appreciate it to be honest with you we we just got all our new vehicles within the last six months um so were not really in a position for many years right now where well be looking to add on to the fleet at the moment
__label__0 you know we we bought a new truck so i i think were probably not going to consider leasing at this point
__label__0 i not uh i dont i dont think so um nope not at this time
__label__0 uhh what what kind okay what is this now uh uh what is it im so sorry im in traffic right now and im about to get on a conference call um can i have you can you can you call me back in one hour
__label__0 uh beats is there any information like an email or something like that beyond that were not really interested like were not really doing anything uh we got a truck a new truck last year ah probably at least inaudible
__label__0 and that i think thats what the plans are for this year is wants to buy another one
__label__0 uh we take em to uh its not well its from uh oxford georgia thats where we take em to to get em their pins and everything we were usin yeah we were usin somebody local but we just didnt have much luck with them and we just started goin all the way to oxford georgia but thats where that auto shop is and we havent had a problem since so they must be doin somethin right
__label__0 oh yeah that sounds good like i said it was weird that he just decided to buy stuff instead so
__label__0 uuuuh well were just a one person show nowadays so its just myself sooo uh like i said were uh real small right now were uh maybe gon na look
__label__0 um were just going to do what were do we dont rent trucks very often
__label__0 yeah i mean ive im im not ever in the market to lease a truck
__label__0 i might be in the market to you know if we have a truck break down rent a truck
__label__0 uh actually friday afternoons not really a good time im sorry um is this in is this in regards to trying to do some truck uh rentals
__label__0 yeah wweve ive already talked to people about that because we haul um steel coils you guys arent actually able to assist with some of our bigger needs with our semis um so its really not a partnership that would work unless we were able to uh you know to talk about being able to haul coils
__label__0 um well i i have i guess the main thing is i have a truck i actually have two semis that we use from time to time we have a need for additional uh but penskes not been able to work with us in the past just not a a spot you know were situational um uh timing so thathats really the biggest obstacle that weve got right now
__label__0 oh they they can but theyve theyve stopped by twice and weve not been able to come up with anything that works so you know i dont know if theyre gon na be able to do to do anything different than weve done in previous years
__label__0 you may check with them and see if thats something that they can even you know that they can even do bbefore making an outside call um were pretty busy here and you know if theres an opportunity if you know if hauling coils is something we can do you know oon a situational basis there may be some opportunity but you know if not it really puts us in a spot where that service doesnt make sense for us
__label__0 um yeah i mean we we we purchase new trucks every year um that that thats just something that uh you know we we just purchased a new facility in greenville south carolina so well need new equipment new vehicles there um you know but like i said uh dealing with that internally has been an easier option than trying to work with uh a service plan that does not include our semis
__label__0 we are not ready uhhh we are not ready yet uhhhuhh just give me a call in a couple of months because were we still going through some stuff
__label__0 well we dont know yet i got to see whats all when we sit down then we can go from there just it would be on for another couple of months and well see whats going on okay
__label__0 i mean what what do you what do you got i mean before i know if we can see if anybody would be interested what are you talking about
__label__0 uh well as far as trucking i know wwere not interested in any trucks right now for sure i i i just had a meeting with our owner and were actually weve got a surplus of vehicles right now and were lookin at gettin rid of some because weve got too many um and then as far as services you know we only have like a couple of larger size two clearly larger sized trucks and ones a box truck and ones a flatbed and thats it you know as far as everything else its just pick up trucks so
__label__0 no i dont think thatd be anything id be interested in but i i appreciate ya callin
__label__0 yeah not right now weve got we had the we talked to you guys about uhh yeah switching over from rider everythings up in the air here right now so we do have a contact weve been dealing with so i told em id give them a call as soon as we uh get any information
__label__0 if we could uh the last the last um week or two of february that would be great
__label__0 i think i talked to him a while back we actually dont have rider um a couple couple years ago we squashed with star so we have about six years left on the contract and all of our tractors and trailers
__label__0 we have nine at this location we have nine tractors umm and then we have four straight trucks
__label__0 mm um well we really do very little going out almost everything we have is coming in so we we really dont use any trucking company only whats sent to us
__label__0 no were not interested in in doing anything through uh through penske weve got our own company vehicles that weve purchased and and do it on our own
__label__0 actually he ended up just buying box trucks so yeah were just not gon na lease em but thank you
__label__0 yeah i wouldnt have time ummm you know we still just have the one straight truck if he wan na just through in some information ummm you know may be i dont know may be eight to sixteen months from now we might need to do something and at that time we would you know we would uhhh reach out to you folks
__label__0 ummm and and give consideration to that versus uhhh you know purchasing you know trying to find a deal for lets say twenty five thirty grands something used ummm and then and then the truck we have now would be our back up so umm i mean i appreciate your time umm if he want to just put this in your file there it might be something required in eight to sixteen months and if that if that happen sooner uhhhh you know i uhhh the didiligence will include reaching out to you folks because we do want to look at it uhhh prior to making a decision does that make sense
__label__0 yeah but uh i i just i just be wasting your time on tuesday i you know ill be brittlely honest so umm
__label__0 but yeah just cacall me back in eight months if you havent heard from me shortly before you know
__label__0 okay yeah i talked to him last year and i been tryna get my son uh involved in that see ii i actually retired two years ago but uh i will reiterate this to him again and uh you know what year they are what what year the trucks are
__label__0 nothin uh ya know i was interested in it i couldnt get my son interested in it but maybe i can now so why dont you give me a call next week and let me give you my cell phone number same area code and its twotwozero twentyfifty ananan actually hes in florida right now he wont be back until saturday and ill talk to him the first of the week and see if i can get him interested in it or at least hell sit down and and we can talk about it
__label__0 actually do you have an uhh the ability to just send that via email cause im im actually really busy right now with uh internal work at the south so my time is is uh very very limited
__label__0 sure be towards the end have towards the end of this month would perhaps be you know the best actually
__label__0 no im not inter i i have i i need drivers i dont need trucks or tradein trucks i got thirty of them parked here i need truck drivers not different trucks thanks for calling though
__label__0 well theres um my name is craig and then theres a greg but hes in another building hold of ts transit or
__label__0 load and go okay this is load and go this is craig so go ahead
__label__0 i dont remember ii talk to so many people in a day heh i dont keep track
__label__0 hes been gone for about a year so its been a while then since youve been here
__label__0 all weve got is owner ops nope all owner ops we got two company trucks that just pick up local loads and deliver local loads so thats it
__label__0 could be hehe cuz we just dont have i know yeah i probably wouldnt be uh
__label__0 thats no problem i just dont want to waste his time you know he could be out making a sale isntead of goofin around with us
__label__0 well were pretty committed to our own fleet of vehicles at the present um well see well see what kind of growth we have this year to see if thats something you know we might consider
__label__0 i actually i want to know what you want to talk to me about anthony and ill tell you whether i have time or not
__label__0 um that is news to me i did not know that any of the branches were leasing any trucks at all
__label__0 okay um anthony im uh im gon na pass uh for now im not uh im not we have we have somebody all lined up that we handle all of our service for our delivery trucks through in measure okay so um yeah
__label__0 um i this is uh like say this is news to me so you have a mobile truck that does service
__label__0 im gon na stop ya im gon na stop ya right there we uh the the company that we purchased the vehicle through has been handling our service since since we bought it brand new and were gon na were gon na stick with them
__label__0 uhhh a moment to talk uhh well im actually at another location oouhh what can i help you with
__label__0 i tell you what uhhh i know were using salem right now uhhh but i can uhhh im trying to think i mean you welcome to to uhhh im thinking im not actually near for worth it all right now im gon na say i mean you well you can email
__label__0 i mean i can i can always call back at a time because im never really at the plants i tend to go back and forth i have another business that i take care of and i deal with that like most of the time then i kinda do the pilot company kinda on the side i go but uhhh
__label__0 uhhhh i mean we have a company that does it but i have guys that to run that but uhh i can uhhh i mean email it to me and ill ill show it to larry and uhhh
__label__0 well go from there i know that i know we have a contract now with with salem and i dont know when it expires i can go but i can get the latter and find out when it does and we can see what you what you got stuff like that
__label__0 and then uhhh then we also got some trailers with them i think we we lease about fifteen trailers from salem
__label__0 um uh actually todays not a great time but uh honestly uh ya know if this has to do with the uh leasing truck that we talked about a couple years ago or so um we we just dont have an interest at this point
__label__0 oh we dont run our own trucks so we weve got a local guy that runs his own trucks and he does pretty much ninety percent of our deliveries for us
__label__0 uhh were happy with the one we bought last year so i dont think were looking to upgrade or update right now
__label__0 uhh we dont have any vehicles at this point in time and uh were not uh really looking for anything like that of that nature
__label__0 coughs well im in charge of part of it but i know we aint upgrading no equipment or doing none of that so we were pretty much were pretty much a hundred percent owner operators
__label__0 well its owneroperator they pretty much just take care of their self laughs its one good thing about having owneroperators
__label__0 well i dont think so because by the time we go through all the headache of going and looking at other insurance carriers and submitting all the loft runs and tax returns and its just its never its never worth it so im really not interested in pricing it out
__label__0 you know we we ummm we currently have uh three trucks in our fleet and ummm were probably not gon na look to do anything for couple of years
__label__0 we actually have a guy that we hire who comes in and he reviews our maintenance schedule he does all of our oil changes and transmissions clutches and all that so we have a loclocal mechanic
__label__0 i think so ummm what happened was we discovered that one of our trucks ummm had the original uh air filter from nineteen ninety four still in it hahaa and uhhummumm another one of our trucks uhhh we dont think the oil had been changed since ummm around two thousand and fourteen so at least three years probably four years and uhhh so we have put them on uhhh pretty vigorous maintenance schedule every three four months he comes in and checks everything and checks our tires and make sure its all up and running we just pay him quarterly to do it
__label__0 so i will encourage you to if you can you know to put us on call up may be in a year from now to see if were looking to buying some trucks or wherwhere were at
__label__0 but literally just got one of our trucks back new vinyl siding and laddering and all that stuff on it and uhuhhh we also to do one of our pickups also
__label__0 no no no cuz we dont need any we reach out when we do need one
__label__0 you know what id love to say yeah but were pretty well set on trucks every once in a while well maybe lease not lease or or rent a truck occasionally we own all of our own trucks were all good and right now were not going to be in the in the market for anything in the near future
__label__0 not right now no were good as a matter of fact um you probably know him jack gallagher ill call him every once in a while whem im lookin for like a used tandem or something that just come off of a lease
__label__0 sure sure and hell turn me on to somebody to go talk to or whatever but usually yeah
__label__0 so if we ever do need something because i think you guys are not too far from us
__label__0 interest me is you you do buy uh trucks we have some older trucks that we are looking to sell
__label__0 okay umm in terms of when you say new programs what are you speaking of in broad classification
__label__0 yeah its going fine um no im pleased i i get short term lease uh packages you know where i ill coughs excuse me ill drive a tractor for three years um i have a an eighty thousand mile limit per year and uh and ive got uh currently right now we have five of them through rider
__label__0 uh i am about a year and a half into it so im about halfway
__label__0 oh it went fine yeah no problem i mean its uh uh initially i had started out with uh um sarah and umm and then and then i went to ccasey after that
__label__0 yeah yeah and and i had uh id given casey a timeline so he he knows when to contact me when its time to you know um look at pricing and and consider other options to rider
__label__0 no im gon na be uh gon na be off the following week so next next week is im gon na be busy getting ready and the weekend that busy yeah an option
__label__0 you know what i dont right now im not interested in i got enough going already so i dont wan na waste your time and mine right now i dont have interest okay
__label__0 no not unless i mean the only thing that im gon na give probably sell in the near future is an old truck that i dont use anymore but no
__label__0 hahaauhhh im really not i guess im trying to decide who i need you to talk to i have got one guy that deals with the tractor trailers and another guy that deals with straight trucks then sprinters
__label__0 okay uhhh it might be best if you wait and call me about a week from today uhhh weve got a meeting next week with a customer that would either create a need ummm for a couple of tractors or it would cause us to get couple uh were gon na two in anyway so its whether or not we replace them but there was no point talking until we have that meeting because if if it doesnt go well then we wouldnt be in the market
__label__0 i would have to wait and see i mean i know im not going to change what im doing as far as i know my trucks and were just were kinda set
__label__0 yeah were running like tracks and dump trucks so that really doesnt get into that where where you guys are at we weve gone this road before
__label__0 uh im already working im already working with one of penskes reps out of pa
__label__0 umm i can look it up i i cant remember im driving right now
__label__0 um it depends what who are you looking for like what dispatch accounting i dont know what youre look
__label__0 oh we have our own shop and we dont do any leasing we just buy all of our equipment trailers everything
__label__0 um rarely but whenever we do we actually do use penske weve probably um rented trucks from you all probably i dont know eight times before
__label__0 need i just wouldnt want to waste that guys time you know what i mean
__label__0 uh i dont know if theres much of a need at this point if you want to send me some information electronically for now we can review it to see what kind of programs youve got going on um i dont think were looking to make any changes i think the lease we have as is is fine um were not looking to add any trucks um at this point and i think the one truck that we have will work but why dont you send me the information electronically and me and a small group here can review that
__label__0 yeah we got we got a penske truck so um yeah take a look at it and you you can yknow send me some information on whatever programs you have and we can review it and if if it does warrant a meeting then uh we can we can have you in
__label__0 not looking to lease right now at all we havent leased for about ten years so
__label__0 um no we dont even hardly ever have any of those issues so but i know that it happens with our fleet being so small
__label__0 but ya we handle mostly everything in house or it gets shipped locally here somewhere to do work so
__label__0 weve leased from you weve bought after the lease was up you know what i mean all that good stuff so we go we we put hardly any miles on our trucks twenty thousand miles thirty thousand a year i mean its real low so
__label__0 what did todd tell him uh i spoke with him before he knows where i stand on it im not really interested in making any changes at this time
__label__0 yeah actually um i called earlier because im having issues with uh someone about uh my billing and and their trying to go to collections and default and i talked to somebody earlier
__label__0 yeah its got ta go above my rep and my district manager because theyre being uh unreasonable
__label__0 uh right now i dont believe there in the market for a truck uh and i dont think that will be any in in in the near future umm
__label__0 for some reason no and i dont remember why i got something going on friday
__label__0 ehmem i tell you what why dont you call me next monday and we could confirm that
__label__0 we there for a while we were using you guys but we have purchased a new truck
__label__0 so um the need for us to have them now is not very often it may be once or twice a year
__label__0 no um and if anything changes theres a number i can reach you guys at
__label__0 uhh no sir im not gon na be im not gon na be interested right in in doing any leasing or anything were were owning we own our tractors now were pretty well set in that moat but i appreciate your interest
__label__0 i appreciate your like i said appreciate your interest in talking with me but at this time were were set pretty well with own owning our own stuff but uh keep in touch
__label__0 no i think i no i think i think im fine um with just with just doing my regular renting out i really um we thought we were going to open up a trucking company uh a logistics company but uh it didnt didnt go through with my partner so
__label__0 um i do but i mean were not you know interested in trucks i can tell you that
__label__0 well actually im im not uh i im i shut the company down so im not so were not running any freight
__label__0 thank you for choosing aarons this is joe what may we deliver to you today
__label__0 uh actually our owner um decided that he wasnt interested in the lease programs and actually was purchasing new trucks instead
__label__0 uhh we do everything just uh with the local shops that are here and just pay for them
__label__0 right yeah when when we went over it with him last time cause i was the one who reached out to have somebody come in and give me some information on it um he decided he wasnt interested in neither one of them
__label__0 mm i dont no i i dont think thats uh the way im headed right now but i appreciate it
__label__0 umm not right now no we we dont want you were not you know we are okay right now uh maybe maybe next two months we might we might do something about um but right now we are okay
__label__0 yeah yeah yeah i do i i uh i have a shop that do the maintenance for for the the trucks
__label__0 because the the the lease uh its too expensive i can not afford it right now um
__label__0 uh well the truth is im not really in the market for doing anymore leases right now i have three leased trucks and i just did my third one a few months ago so its going to be a while before im ready to do anything new
__label__0 you can always email me something you know i i was dealing with uh i think his name was aaron over there
__label__0 um so yeah you guys should have my info youre welcome to just send me anything you want but i dont i dont see it as being productive to sit down and you know go over anything at this point
__label__0 ummm at a time i dont know if thats necessary weve purchased van and well since we purchased since we rented from you always also purchased one of yours trucks
__label__0 mmhmm okay all right well give me a number that i can call you back at
__label__0 i do not think so we are not going to consolidate our service because it is a lot of its local to local people actually as well
__label__0 no no no no no no but we have a lot of local cont little local mechanics that we do biz do business with so it is not all we are not going to be consistent throughout we are not going to have a one in all service program
__label__0 i mean he could but we dont even i mean we just use pickup trucks for what we get were were kind of of a small one
__label__0 uh i mean thatd be fine ive been talking with patton whos the i believe the manager of the local uh location here over the last couple of weeks so he has given me a proposal for for lease and and longerterm rentals but neither of those are really costeffective for what i need
__label__0 well i have a uh a show i do in town once a month that i i rent a truck for uh a couple of days for and thats and then if i have any you know long distance deliveries i would rent a truck but thats pretty sporadic
__label__0 i think he only gave me rental rates to be honest with ya i think he we looked at it and the lease was not uh
__label__0 i mean just from doing the show here locally um uh we do like a hundred and fifty two hundred miles doing the show so its not its not that much um thats all known ahead and then its hard for me to predict what its going to be otherwise
__label__0 well that would be okay other than we just got a truck from you guys um a couple months ago
__label__0 no no as i said we just uh we got well we got one from you guys that i wan na say is three years ago we got in like an oheight and this year i think we got a thirteen if im not mistaken and we got that just in too and so we got those trucks and theyre theyre working fine so were all set
__label__0 im not buying im not gon na buy nothing or lease nothing its all in house
__label__0 umm uh what department are you guys coming from are you talking about the rental or the lease
__label__0 uh at this time uh we are our fleet can uh fully stock uh loaded so i a lease doesnt look like its gon na be likely its just not it
__label__0 um sputters ii guess it depends on what youre looking for how long a moment i have
__label__0 um i we are good we have been down that road weve got a nasty case thereabouts from several people from sev and im not saying penske was one of them um but we are uh we are good on that front but thank you
__label__0 mm probably no right now i mean youd have to call me you know i dont i youd probably have to call me on monday evening
__label__0 yall have done some work for us in the past is that what youre saying and you anand what company are you with

__label__0 we have purchased a used vehicle at this time and and actually have downsized the fleet significantly i do not see us pursuing a lease within the next twelve to eighteen months
__label__0 appreciate the followup as always if there would be something that would we be changed we have your guyss contact information on file youre very courteous and astute with getting us the information that we needed for the lease and be happy if the if the situation would change to be in contact with you folks again
__label__0 uh i think we did that before and its uh were were good though appreciate it
__label__0 uhh you know man im im good right now im good i i appreciate it though
__label__0 uhh yeah were not looking at doing that at the present time uh probably in the spring time its something well look at
__label__0 um ill be honest with ya i i dont need any of your services right now um i know that you guys have called us a few other times but um we have access to so many trucks ourselves that um we have our own facility so theres not excuse me sorry theres nothing that um that i could use you for
__label__0 uh not for for us uh i mean all our locations have the same situation we have enough vehicles and uh spare vehicles parked along the fence and facilities to maintain em
__label__0 uh just give me a few uh let me check my calendar can you send me an email and a girl will get in contact with you and well let you know
__label__0 yeah man i really tell you i dont i just dont believe thatll work for us but most of my guys is owner operators i dont mean you know i just i dont even i i got five trucks and five trailers ive had for six seven years i mean you know what i mean
__label__0 ive got a ive got a mechanic shop with a full time mechanic in there two full time mechanics yeah and i work on uh my owner operator stuff too
__label__0 not right now uh because ill tell you why um theyre nice trucks ive done ive overhauled the motors and ive have them painted and re you know sorta refurbished and everything ill tell you why ive kept them old trucks is uh cause of e logs if its if its a ninety nine or model older truck and ive got ninety eight ninety nine model three seventy nine extended hood peterbilts and uh none of those trucks has e logs and thats why ive kept em
__label__0 thats right and i dont really wan na deal with deal with all that you know what im saying
__label__0 tell you what give me a call later in the week i mean see what my availability might me
__label__0 uhh we just dont have any need for the trucks right now um we just have two at our existing storage facilities and we we own our own trucks so uh no matter how good the deals are we just we dont have a need for it right now
__label__0 yeah yeah the trucks are in pretty good shape so its mostly just oil changes and stuff like tires here and there
__label__0 umm no next couple weeks are pretty pretty darn busy and i know our we got our uh fleet we call him a category manager and our fort wayne indiana office its uh uh hes been discussing with someone so i think hes up to date on the programs
__label__0 um shes not here today shes working from home is there um something i can help you with or you uh can send her an email she said too
__label__0 um i i guess i could talk to you about that more or less if you need something
__label__0 um i mean honestly not really at this time were just were doing all of our own stuff you know were motor rebuilds trans everything so uh
__label__0 um bodywork we dont really have any bodywork if we do um it goes under insurance claims so that kinda just goes wherever it they tell us to i think we last time went to rendells
__label__0 yeah i mean all of the mechanics side and fleet you know keeping up with oil changes and stuff that all gets done here
__label__0 ummm well i dont know i think weve been just pretty lucky about that actually but um i mean ya know like i said i guess they probably would just have a blowout or somethin and um i dont know who they call then its probably ta or something or wherever wherever were around
__label__0 okay um i mean i dont know if you wan na if you wan na call back and then um see when shes you know available and i know shes not here today like i said so if you wanted to talk with her when she is maybe call back tomorrow or something
__label__0 im really not interested youre youre youre gon na talk about leasing and things like that
__label__0 yeah well i deal locally with international dealer for my trucks uh and my service
__label__0 um you may have the wrong number this is no john this is uh ivy acres
__label__0 my name is james john you would be me yeah thats your john its james
__label__0 well you know we really dont need any uh any of the services at this time we actually purchased a truck that were using as a backup right now so if any of our other trucks go offline were able to just use that as uh a backup truck so i yeah i think if uh if it comes to the point where i do need something ill definitely be in touch with you guys
__label__0 okay great well i ive got ta run im a little late for a meeting but i appreciate the call
__label__0 ummm well we dont um lease trucks very much um we we um have this ice and uh company that we subtract to that does all that but um ya know thought of us as an office furniture dealer and um so we sell office furniture i dont know any reason we would need to lease many trucks we
__label__0 we own um two trucks yeah that inaudibleone of them we uh new innovation or finely king ventilation bought it out and we basically rent it back to our installation company umm the other one yeah we own and uh we do have uh uh two of our own delivery guys that that drive that on it yeah yeah drride that every day
__label__0 they all get serviced uh where we bought it but i dont know if um i dont even know if were allowed to go anywhere else but i guess i would have to check with our operations guy on that but uh i think we have a contract of some sort um i really dont think that would be able to take any time to sit down and talk to you right now anyway or we got uh too much goin on with taxes and stuff
__label__0 we tried that and we have a a leasing company now thats working full tilt with us so i dont think anybody would be interested at the time you yup bye now
__label__0 yeah ive got two vehicles literally coming uh in march so im good right now
__label__0 no were leasing a hundred per a hundred percent but we still got a couple that you know we still use in our line but wwwere gon na wait until next year
__label__0 um no i im not interested but uh you know if we ever get in a situation where we need you guys well call you in
__label__0 uh probably not no i i dont think were gon na be interested in doing anything like that
__label__0 um its kinda well to be honest were kind of up in the air on whether we gon na continue to uh lease out a truck
__label__0 um uh actually we may be um not needing a tractor here in the next few months
__label__0 we may need uh not a a not per say a truck we may need um like a yard dog
__label__0 umm next week im im out of town week after next she can reach out to me week after next
__label__0 i dont know that we have any needs for a truck in the near future but i appreciate your call
__label__0 we we did a leasing with you so i believe hopefully that we will not going to have any needs for the any maintenance for may be a year or
__label__0 better than more so i believe ahhahhh i believe this could be fine for now right
__label__0 uhhh i dont think were gon na do anything right right now at this point in time you might wan na check back maybe about uhhhuhh springtime will start coming about uh march something like it
__label__0 maybe we have something you know we will need you know i hate to waste you guys time came by here you know and were not gon na do anything at that time
__label__0 yeah were not really wewe dont maintain any we dont keep any vehicles we just kind of change our vehicle from uhh box truck kind of vehicle to a truck and trailer so we arent uhh wewe really dont have a maintenance issue like we used too on large truck and then we already we we use you guys anytime we need of uhh truck type vehicle you guys are a go to source for that so
__label__0 ththe sales call probably wouldnt benefit us or you any because we already love you and hahaa and so whewhen we do need truck we use them and uhh we arent maintaining a truck any longer so ummumm a bigger fish to fry than a small
__label__0 yeah yeah weve already yeah ive already talked with the folks so we weve been in touch
__label__0 yeah yeah i spoke to uh to to bob and um i cant remember the other folks name
__label__0 well yeah i mean he was just here i mean i dont need to see him again i know who he is where he is ill contact him if i need him
__label__0 uh noe were not were just quite happy with our one truck and thats where were gon na stay
__label__0 um actually so all of our all of our services cause we have so many different departments if i met with everybody that wants to come in and show us what they do i would never get anything done so what im what were doing if you can send me an email im gon na give ill uh send you the link were putting everything that were bidding out on planet bids any time were doing these sort of like service agreements maintenance agreements any of that kind of stuff its all going out on planet bids so if you send me your email i can send you the link and then you can register as one of our vendors so then when it goes out youll be um notified
__label__0 right right so its like a fleet maintenance okay first of all we have our own internal fleet maintenance people here but occasionally theres something that happens where well you know itll go beyond the expertise of and in those cases we have like master service agreements with with vendors we would put that out um out on planet bid and say were looking for an oncall maintenance um company that and we would give them the scope of the kinds of services that were looking for this is our equipment and then if its appropriate then you would be able to submit your i guess a fleet schedule and we would select like one or two vendors to sort of have on call
__label__0 my email is a d as in david ehoyos as in sam at dur dot org so its a dehoyos at dur dot org my name is alicia
__label__0 no actually weve been in contact um weve been dealing with trying to get out of a lease right now were actually sending were going to be sending one of the trucks back so weve been negotiating that
__label__0 uhh was it no no wait josh wwwhat i forgot who our sales rep is now i had his card here and now i dont know what i did with it yeah hes been in a couple times already
__label__0 i was yeah i was actually it was actually a a lady um that was
__label__0 yep and we were we were in the process of doing something and then i never heard from her again
__label__0 its two tractors and a rollback yeah my my my uh stick body i just send to a local shop here for oil changes and stuff like that
__label__0 and he he my uh my local guy can actually do d and t inspections and stuff like that for the small trucks
__label__0 well nate i am not interested at all in the big g side but we work with penske now and are all right with this and were very active with penske every day we dont like transportation like transport us its gon na cost more than penske now assisting years so we are we are in constant communication with with uhhh penske
__label__0 now on the big g side now there is no interest in sitting down having that meeting again we just had that meeting not long ago
__label__0 uhh actually we downsize so umm i really dont use trucks anymore most farm activities are struck with job to the job site now
__label__0 oh you know i have kind of uhh settled in on actual buying rather than
__label__0 yeah i i got that so so sorry you know i am i am just going to just stick the way i am doing it
__label__0 uhh we never have had a program with you and we never have lease or even rented or anything like that and we dont plan to well
__label__0 i tell you what i uhh i tell you we might better pass on this meeting this time like here because i dont see where i can help you and i dont know that you can help me at this point
__label__0 yeah we do have everything all dialed and i got two different venders that handle all that for us
__label__0 uhhh i ahh at this point i i wouldnt really have a need uhh may be check back in in another three four months
__label__0 so i dont want to waste your time here but obviously whenever that time comes up well well get a hold on you guys and lets quote
__label__0 you know that is a seven year deal i think we got about another year and half left on it i think
__label__0 well uhh they uhmm i going to pay like aaa twenty two hundred a month uhmm
__label__0 are these are these units that you are offering for sale for lease for rental what
__label__0 uhh what what type of units that we are talking about were talking about trucks trailers tractors
__label__0 well i can tell you right now uhh i ill like to have you hold off for just a little bit if i can we are right in the process of uhhh we actually have been working with greg williams
__label__0 what we are doing is uhhh we have a pretty good understanding at what we need for equipment this year uhhh in regards to replacements for what is failingyeah okay
__label__0 uhhh may be even looking at leasing new equipment and what he wanted me to do is go ahead and get all the pricing put together on new trailers and i have got four bids back now so i have a rough idea of what we want and if we if we go through penske to lease i i just needed to provide him with a capital number uhhh you know uhh retest that what we are looking at so the cost of it so i just got that in yesterday okay so ill ill be following back up with greg and let him know kind of ahmmuhh ourourour truck and tractor uhh needs right now arent great
__label__0 but our trailers uhhh are we we basically need somewhere between twenty to thirty six trailers to replace though this year so uhhh the company has deferred that for a longtime so we need to take a really strong look at do we buy new do we buy used what they have been doing or do we lease uhh and i have got some analy good analysis work done uhhh and the the last part of that was we met with greg earlier this year
__label__0 oh last year yeah last year thats right and him you know one of the things we were not real uhh excited about is that penske didnt have any type of the capital lease or or like a track lease where we can get the depreciation and secondly they werent willing to unbundle uhh werent willing to unbundle uhh the maintenance cost so i dont know if anything has changed but we we have at least three or four other uhh options and solutions to go with uhhh where they are very flexible and they offer unbundling all those types of services so so penske the last time we went through this and kind of analyze and got close
__label__0 penske was the least attractive option and so unless anything is changing its not that we wouldnt look at it again its just unless anything else changes we dont want to be uhhh we dont want to be tied to your maintenance program and we we got the sales pitch on it
__label__0 but be honest we we rented some trucks this last summer and fall and we got some of them tied up in your shop for two three weeks at a time and they were no substitutes or replacements and then we got billed for them even though they were in the shop and we had to get the billing reversed and everything in it and it didnt work like you guys claimed it would you know like if we are leasing and we have substitutes uhhh you know because the rentals we were saying well you know get us another truck and they said nothing is available and supposedly if we lease the substitutes that were guaranteed arent not you know its not guaranteed but promised uhhh arent there you know summer months are really really hot uhhh in southern california and and reefer trucks are hard to find so we ran into some issues operational issues with that with penske already so uhh all the claims that were made we didnt find them to be
__label__0 service we have a full service shop and we have great relationships with femoral king directly and trailers suppliers we feel we can manage that a lot better than you guys can i know you are big operation i know youve got a lot of resources but be honest with you
__label__0 just judging by the the rental uhh fleet and and getting that in and out of the local uhh shop for just maintenance it was uhh we had two to three weeks downtime for every vehicle no matter what it was in that
__label__0 so so there is a little bit of a red flag there im telling you from a real life experience all standpoint versus what the claim was but we were happy to visit it again thats what i told greg we are happy to visit again any ways but we are still going to kind of be asking for so that uhhh you know unbundling especially the maintenance uhhh services and that kind of things we have got like a set of full service shop here plus our ceo its a big stickler for him he is the money guy
__label__0 and uhhh he wants to be able to get some kind of appreciation often even for leasing
__label__0 so i plan on i plan on sending him an email uhhh probably early next week
__label__0 and actually may be even by tomorrow to just trying to give him uhh an average number for what these trailers came back uhh if we buy them our specs and he just needs that number because he is working off of a capital amount you know i mean
__label__0 i was going to give him that and give him a quantity and see because the quantity we are pulling around with now is twenty but it really we need to be closer to thirty six but uhh he can comeback and say hey here is where we can be and offer some difference solutions like may be may be five seven and ten year leases and you know whatever they wanted to do with the residuals uhhh is lots of things we can do we understand but at least kind to get something to compare to ryders then ryders got a product now i am not not a big ryder fan i will be honest
__label__0 aaahh i had some i worked for a company in the past that spent twenty years now but the service was was really lacking and the cost of those lease we inherited from a company we acquired and we couldnt get out of those things and they were really expensive leases and the services wasnt great uhhh but now they have got a product where they unbundle everything and they have got different options for taking the capital depreciation and all that so
__label__0 aaahh we are going to go to you guys and the ryder and uhhh you know there is a couple other leasing companies that we have align on that one our business that our just in leasing you know or financing
__label__0 so were going to look at those as well but thththe penske product uhhh came out in the bottom uhh last time we went and did this whole round and we looked at about seven different solutions and it came right down at the bottom just because of limited uhhh limited options or you guys call them solutions you know
__label__0 well you know costumer from a customer standpoint we want you to take the risk hahaha
__label__0 but were were happy to look at it again and go the next round because we are probably looking at uhhh either buying some uhhh you know good number of new trailers uhhh or leasing
__label__0 okay but i will be working directly with greg i dont want to double up either so
__label__0 what is that you are selling andor releasing is it is it internationals hinos or what
__label__0 it varies honestly uhhh its its you know whatever is coming off of a rental fleet we just settle with that because we that was the other thing we noticed that we got stuck with the bunches of max force engines too and they are nightmare and they cost us we can tell you the exact amount of money it cost us in a period of time and we got zero help and support from international on that so we got stuck with them
__label__0 and it cost us yearly so we are we are in the process of of uhh trying to you know to attrition recycle those things out of the fleet as quick as we possibly can which isnt soon enough so in the meantime you know we we made an engine change we made aaa we made a product we made a truck change and uhh we have been trying trying to purposely stay away form international and max force uhh so that kind it doesnt help us much either
__label__0 we have our own we have our own service trucks we have our own field mechanics uhhh yeah we dont we try not to outsource anything
__label__0 well nate i thank you very much for the call this morning we do in our company have for all our facilities a full scale shop services and we do maintain all of our fleet inhouse
__label__0 we typically service otr breakdowns either using our own inhouse staff or in the case of some emergencies well use uhhh michelle and b2b services etc
__label__0 that sounds terrific happy to have you follow up in the future perhaps will be more in the position or willing or desiring of the discussion at that time
__label__0 actually i have not uhh i have not been doing anything in the uhh trucking we were actually starting up uhh last year
__label__0 and things did not go as planned so it it has been put on hold
__label__0 not at this point umm but well definitely bring you guys in when its time for an rsq but at this point there is no rsq thats going out
__label__0 it looks like next ten days is pretty pretty tied up lets look it out maybe after the middle of february like after the twenty second
__label__0 that will be in hayward if you want to stop by because we handle all of uhh operations on the hayward location
__label__0 no its by appointment only so i need to find line at which time uhhh you know you can have him send by
__label__0 yeah just send me an email so i can look up at my schedule and i can get back to you with my timings
__label__0 nate we didnt get that government contract so we dont lease out vehicles on this time umm i would prefer if you know you guys dont contact me because there is nothing to discuss right
__label__0 i appreciate you are following up but thats just its not really a good use of anyones time hahahaha
__label__0 yeah i do not i am sorry but yeah we went with enterprise and uhh so we are good for next enterprise for next three years
__label__0 we currently are under lease with another company uhhh for the next six years so i dont think its something we are gon na to be looking in doing anything with so i think
__label__0 aaahhwe have bought two vans and so we are in good shape for a while
__label__0 yeah i uhhh you know i do not use them anymore i mean i used to use you guys but uhhh i have my own truck now so i do not use you guys anymore
__label__0 one of my trucks need service so if you give me a number over there i will call and get a quote
__label__0 well is it really a schedule maintenance program where they constantly calling me in uhh
__label__0 want to uhh you know i take if i take it in uhhh no hahaa i just do not use my truck enough i mean it sits for a couple of weeks at a time so
__label__0 no you know we we bought a couple of new trucks we are in good shape
__label__0 no they are new trucks we take them back to the dealer and when they
__label__0 yeah listen i am i am not i have actually bought three trucks that you rent uhh
__label__0 for your some promotional stuff that we had going on so i have got three large trucks and uhh back in about the middle of november
__label__0 and we are just a construction fleet so we dont really put many miles on a vehicle we just drop to a job site stay there all day and drive back
__label__0 we are not we are not going to be in the market for anything uhhh probably this whole year but if we do it will be a replacement at the very end of the year so and i just hope like theres any need anything coming right now but i appreciate you are calling and reaching out you are welcome to check back with me at the towards the end of the year okay
__label__0 i think we are good right now we are kind of restructuring everything here so i think were good
__label__0 to still get a follow up in like six months or so you think that is better timeyeah that will be fine definitely check back then
__label__0 uhhh i am just sitting grovers parking lot let me park my car very quick
__label__0 i am doing good i actually got an email from you guys there basically in it thanks but no thanks which came as a shock to hear from you
__label__0 uhhh it might have been frables like a regional manager position i think he was reg rations manager
__label__0 for leasing of car uhhh leasing of trucks that i had for my last job
__label__0 uhhh actually buddy i do not i do not work there anymore i am i am actually looking for job right now they did a restructure restructure the company and they limited much position and i would one of them
__label__0 yeah thank you for calling i thought you are calling from a crew site of hahaaah
__label__0 no ashley i am i am going to tell you that it is not something our company would uhh have any have any use for it we have got all of our own all of our guys
__label__0 yeah we have got two here so and we have got i think uhhh seventy seven throughout the company so yeah
__label__0 yeah uhhh i appreciate it but we would not be interested at this time but i appreciate you make to know us
__label__0 well i think well you know thththe only time i really use the penske is is you know when our truck is down
__label__0 you know that we call you guys and you help us out and we you know hire the truck for the afternoon or for you know a couple of days and that would really really be the only time you know that i would say okay so is there any programs that are really different than what would apply for somebody like us to use this only a will call
__label__0 only a couple of days so i probably say it is not really you know one of those things where you know its every week or every month or something like that it is not that at all
__label__0 you know you know when we have gone out to work with you guys we spent you know really nice relationships so you know we are happy for that
__label__0 the reason the reason we used ricks which is just two doors down from us sixty six is because they are deal to inspect them so they they can do all of that work as well
__label__0 versus going out and come in come out you guys and dropping the truck off and having someone you know follow on and picking them up or you know doing that just more convenient you know to go ahead and just go two doors down and have it done that way
__label__0 but hey listen obviously if i was located at where you guys are located i use you all the time
__label__0 well i mean it has been at least that but i mean it just not in our program at the moment we are not you know we are doing
__label__0 no i mean were were good shape we dont need to sell i dont want to sell mmy i mean were just we are good
__label__0 ahhhh i am i am not leasing any equipment if that is what you are calling about
__label__0 uhhh what were doing is were in the process of hiring a new fleet manager here so what i suggest to do is you follow up in a about of a month and then we can uhhh may be put you in touch with someone who is gon na be thats thats job is gon na be the responsibility
__label__0 yeah call me and then i can put you in touch with the the guy or the girl whoever is taking over the fleet
__label__0 if it is the major work we would send to somewhere else but other than everything has done here in the shop
__label__0 you know i appreciate the call but i am under impending sale so i would not be here that much longer
__label__0 yeah whenever you guys uhhhh are available you can always only come in uhhhh the important thing is to be able to speak to the owner who is not here very frequently ummm and i have to ask him if you know if he has been going to be leasing more trucks uhhh because i do not want t to waste your time nor my time either
__label__0 uhmmm i guess uhhhh give me a call if you want in a couple of days to check if i was able to talk to him and uhhhh and i well let you know we can schedule a time to to meet
__label__0 i just want to make sure he is in the market for what you guys are offering i mean we are we have got services of ryder at the moment
__label__0 yeah we turn some in mmmhmmm we turn some in uhhhh anyway yeah let me let me talk to the owner like i said i do not want to bring you guys out here or somebody out here and he and you know uhhhh and then tell you we are not really looking for anything so hahaa uhhh phone or
__label__0 right i think he can give me a call but lelet me let me ummm do you know anything about our company
__label__0 mmmm is independently ummm we do not use the reyes fleet management so i guess what i am telling you is if we go with anybody else it would be the reyes fleet management who does all our beer distributors all of our mcdonalds distributors all of our cocacola distributors
__label__0 yoyoyou are talking about uhhh i i i think you know what i i
__label__0 and the meaning and so but we are we are kind of separate but you know mmm we are looking into going over to the reyes fleet management that
__label__0 it is kind of an outside service that is is actually part of our company
__label__0 you know uhhh if it were i think we got fifteenth largest independently own company in united states
__label__0 ummm i was in about umm in the middle of something so its been so long to be a moment
__label__0 uhhh probably not a good time now uhhh can we just like that uhhh later on uhhh probably some time in march
__label__0 about the month from now and then well probably get together sit down and talk okay
__label__0 we are pretty good they are skilled set of mechanics so we are doing good
__label__0 uhhhh if they are within range we will go get them ourselves ummm and then over the road they have got uhhh got a service uses them i am not sure who
__label__0 i have already had that i have actually had to cancel a contract that i had with ryder recently because ahh
__label__0 it seemed to be little bit of a pain to them and i cant always get on you know on point with ththe scheduling and i know you guys are penalizers we found the ryder has panelized for
__label__0 we have contracts for dm services that havent been done in a timely manner so
__label__0 just they you know just to help them and help myself i just went ahead and cancel it i mean its great and everything like that and ryder is great
__label__0 yeah so ahh you know i have i have heard a lot of different things about you guys and i know you guys are are great and your service is great and everything else like that but it just wasnt the proper fit for said our locations
__label__0 ahh yes maam were just using a local we are using central truck and equipment repair so basically they can cover us across the board when it comes to our maintenance
__label__0 uhhh probably the one you gon na need to talk is this about trucks and stuff like that
__label__0 ahhhh and as far as maintenance right now weve got a deal with freightliner that works on our trucks
__label__0 ahhh probably not right now we would we we have just done a deal with the first of the year with freightliner on maintenance on our trucks so
__label__0 you know the only trucks we have are just small uhh like three quarter ton vans and pickups we dont have any heavy trucks
__label__0 uhhhh no sir on those three quarter tons trucks and were good for a while
__label__0 uhhh and i mean is there a specific scope with any scope of services that you just possible for
__label__0 ummm you know could i mean can we look at may be sometime mid march i think would be a little bit better because i have a lot of projects going on right now i think it would be best to uhhh
__label__0 uhhh you know i have to check internally just to see who is available on what day uhhh before i could tentatively set it up umm you know if you could give me ummm your contact information then i can look into and to give you a callback or email you back
__label__0 uhhh no i actually do not sorry i am a little on the busy side what what is about
__label__0 no man we are good we have already setup we do not need penske sorry buddy
__label__0 uhhh okay uhh you know i think uhhh this is more on a mind of what they are trying to do futuristically
__label__0 yeah we are we are good in that we had you guys in here a couple of years ago and it did not did not really pan out uhh
__label__0 we are we are in pretty good shape running our own place right now so
__label__0 i appreciate you checking in and as things can always change so you know you know you can check back again in six months or whatever but for now i do not waste your time or my at this point
__label__0 ahh i think ahh i guess i mean there is there are host of things and triggers but i think the biggest thing is aaa the guys that came in here were ahhh set up to more handle over the road trucks and we really heavy hall and some very unique needs and it just seems like the programs and thethe vision and the ideas that penske had just did not translate well indarindoor heavyhall arena
__label__0 aa not saying that might not be different now but we have basically gone through we had sold all our parts we had got rid of mechanics and we had a start back up again so umm things are going well now and i am not really looking forward to get into ahh another avenue like that so
__label__0 naa no i mean at this point i got enough more things going and that is just not a pain point for me right now
__label__0 all right well i appreciate your call and have a good rest of the week
__label__0 well you might umm you might as well save your time because right now we are in lease for another four years so
__label__0 and you know it all reverts back with the same thing you know back when i was uhh when i was ordering the truck and may be you are just to order may be you do not back when i first started my business and we want to order truck i i leased the truck through penske the whole time i was with bluebeckers and when i left there i started my own business i like penske and called you guys up to price out a truck for us and i had a quote back from ryder in three days and i was ready to order a truck it took seven weeks to get one from penske and
__label__0 you guys lost my account yeah hahaait is just where it is at i got to tell you ryder has been fantastic i have had no issue so i seriously got all shopped around i mean you know when the time comes for a new truck we will you know required price possibly price you guys but ryder has been fantastic i got i got no issues
__label__0 i have given you probably call twice i called twice during that for you guys and look what you guys own
__label__0 you know unfortunately costing you guys the account but you know i mean i really have no i have no issues with ryder they treated us fair and pricing has not been bad so i am i am a kind of guy who is not broke i do not fix it so
__label__0 ahh yeah yeah ahh i have spoken with you guys before somebody else had called me a day before so
__label__0 anthony we had already looked that in the past and they just did not work for us with our locations and everything like that i appreciate it but it just it is not a good fit for us we we we have been down this track before and talked with you guys and just for our locations and all everything it is not a good fit right now on that
__label__0 i am sorry i just i i do not have the time ahh to talk on something like this i apologize but i just
__label__0 okay yeah were i mean were were in a seven year contract with them and were were not really looking to get new trucks at anypoint soon um if you want to check back in like a year we things may have changed by then but at this point it would just be a waste of time
__label__0 and if youve really want you know steer to check check back in cause things do change you know maybe give me a year you know eighteen months something like that and and if you want to put it on the radar thatd be fine
__label__0 no i mean i am pretty happy where we are getting our truck service and everything right now
__label__0 well the only only reason we have made the lease one is if we had a truck down or something and right now we got about two spares
__label__0 no i cant i cant afford your guyss rates man uh i cant afford much more than a two or three hundred dollar payment a month and the price you guys quoted me was just completely out of my lifetime budget i think
__label__0 uhh yeah early enough on a monday morning but um does this by any chance have to do with vehicle leasing
__label__0 iii i probably will not heres the skinny weve got a pretty comfortable relationship with both um aizuzu of north america and ford motor credit and um i dont think at this point we need to expand that horizon anymore so so i thank you for your time and i wish you a very productive week okay
__label__0 so we are uhh im not looking to go ahead and uhhh get one now ummm it might start back up once some more projects are coming in but right now thats been put on hold
__label__0 you can give me a call back in about six months call me back in june
__label__0 well lets try to get may be in month or so right now im kinda tied up
__label__0 ummmuh yes probably i dont um im not in my office i dont have my schedule in front of me ummm could i give you my email address and have you send me
__label__0 thats the good one and i i think its uhuh highes who ive spoken within the past using the portland office and im not sure it would be the person im meeting up with he left me a message a while back too so i can even reach out to him
__label__0 well not not just real soon here but our owner actually passed away we we are actually in in the process of reorganizing the company the other family members are taking over but its just been a couple of weeks here so ummm things are a little topsyturvy and uhhh theyre just reorganizing under a different corporate structure and that kind of things so right now
__label__0 honestly i would say probably something like may or june would be a little bit better our our need is not immediate i know there is some construction time on the vehicles that we would be looking for for leasing but ummm like i said probably wont make any types of uhhh purchases uhhh you know in the next couple of months after do one thing
__label__0 if you would yeah ive got your folder on my desk here to i just uhh we hope to do something after the first of year and then unfortunately its unfortunate circumstances here and so
__label__0 yeah uhhh i tell you what uhhh yeah lets wait a couple of weeks because im really really busy next two to three weeks you give me about a month and call back and ill ill take the time to look at it
__label__0 oh okay well ththis is my cell phone number i think you you may have got it uh crossed over with kyles but uh i may be able to help you whats going on
__label__0 uhh probably not i mean weve been scattered all over most of the uh eastern uh europe here um so im not sure if anything can really wide enough to set up an appointment maybe you can have your sales rep come out and then uh uh and well be here but uh iif you want i can give you an email address and you can shoot over whatever information
__label__0 okay mmy email is david david at uh eps thats e as in edward p as in paul s as in sam dot solar solar
__label__0 no this is fine i think what happened was it just probably got forwarded through the um the the call center here sometimes it forwards over if somebody else is on the other line so
__label__0 that could probably take us an hour to get the truck down there so um definitely not interested and and i every time we need to have a truck serviced i dont want to drive it through town to get down to you so until you guys get something on the north side i wont even be entertaining the the thought
__label__0 okay maybe uh could they send me an email first cause i dont want to waste their time i just want to see what they have to offer and ill tell them yeah this looks good or no it doesnt look good because were doing okay right now as far as our fleet management goes
__label__0 yeah but we cutting we just resigned up our our new lease with the uh um our new uh whos the new lease people now used to be um yeah we we just signed a new lease with someone so we wouldnt be able to participate
__label__0 um whats it regarding because we weve got our own driver pool so were not interested in dedicated driver services and weve got our own shop
__label__0 yeah i i dont think were interested like like i said we weve got our own own driver pools already and here were doin it
__label__0 no but wwweve looked at it in the past we weve got our own investment into our shop and services and everything and were going to stay that way
__label__0 tell ya we just we just have the one truck and uh were just happy we just get it serviced uh yeah a couple times a year and we dont run it a whole lot and uh yeah it really doesnt uh i mean we didnt have any complaints with penske when we were with them but uh really just cant justify all the cost for none more than we run the truck
__label__0 no right we just do our own deliveries here and it may not go out but once a week for a couple hours or so
__label__0 thank you for calling habitat for humanity this is amy how can i help you
__label__0 yeah probably we just got a new truck um so at this time were kind of not really um needing any assistance with anything like that but yeah you could call back at another time
__label__0 um i dont really have time to talk right now would you like my email address you could shoot me an email maybe
__label__0 um we wont be needing any im weve already taken care of that for this year
__label__0 well uh at the moment i have no authorization to do anything uh weve been sold to a new company and hadnt really met the new owners yet
__label__0 yeah and like i said ive only met with the guys a couple of times and just hadnt got anything set in stone on what way were gon na go
__label__0 i i said i i purchased a truck uh last summer so i actually i now own my own truck so i got im not right now
__label__0 uh nate i appreciate what youre doing and i know its hard work not a lot offun but were not interested thanks
__label__0 well we dont really have a need for a truck right now or the budget for one i should say
__label__0 no were sort of were we we just we just got a uh new new truck through a grant last year and uh you know so so the uh unfortunately replacing our other truck isnt really an option right now um but i appreciate your reaching out and uh if you wanted to you know schedule out you know reach back out in a year or so maybe well be in a different situation
__label__0 well one of em you know one of ems fully covered uh through the through the grants they have no norepair cost and uh um really we we partner with a with a a a dealership in town that provides everything at about a ninety percent discount so its a you know its we its weve very minimal very minimal costs on that um so its not that i dont appreciate what you guys are offering but uh i know its not going to be a you know productive use of anyones time unfortunately so
__label__0 i mean actually we take care of the maintinence ourselves and uh were actually not available to purchase any trucks at this point
__label__0 that um thats fine but i mean i mean were not were not in the were not were not available to purchase or do any purchasing at this point
__label__0 um you know what um tuesday would be good but uh think hed have time to review some of it over the phone tomorrow
__label__0 ummm i just dont have a good sense of my schedule yet so id hate to put some anything down on there
__label__0 please dont feel free to give scott my number and tell him to feel free to call because ah definitely ininterested in seeing what the new programs id be uh do you have um a good insight to some of the details rough rough details on on your new programs for twenty seventeen
__label__0 you know for now were not interested and we just we just done the last truck with penske so i dont think we wan na do anything with penske at this stage right now and we were customer of yours for ten years so sigh
__label__0 weve just sent no no its just costwise no no i mean it just doesnt make sense for us
__label__0 nope nope nope let me speak uh your uh at this point the penskes run thirteen feet one or theirteen feet in height uh typically is what weve uh what weve you know when we were renting from you guys on a daily basis you know all the trucks we got from you were thirteen feet or more um we we never could get a lower truck height so that prohibits us from getting through the uh the lincoln tunnel so we ordered we ordered a custom units um that and leased it for three years um out of a new jersey based um uh leasing company and weve been enjoying it now since uh i think july or sometime in july when we received tthe units and its a two thousand seventeen and its really were really exited about it so were real happy with it
__label__0 yeah its its iit pays for itself and we dont have additional business should we get larger though thats a different story and then wed be on the on the market for another one
__label__0 nope we maintain them i go to west palm beach and i go to jupiter
__label__0 yup i got a body man here and me and one of my other guys are engine builders and transmission builders
__label__0 um i i would say we would but you know the truck that we have is um well weve gone the full use of a third party uh provider so uh theres really no um no vehicle here of any substance to to put into a program
__label__0 yeah you know i know how it goes but no we are not right now i mean i have got like another trucks they dont want to do that fleet service thing is somewhat what i yeah
__label__0 um i mean i dont know if ill be around but i i mean as far as knowing about i i know right now that im not doing enough that im gon na try and lease a truck or anything i appreciate you callin but uh i i mean ill be honest with ya id be wasting your time and my time both because um no more no more we got goin on we got two old trucks that are one of thems paid for and one of them nearly is when i had talked to yall id talked about hiring a driver to pull a trailer full time and uh i got eh i ended up throwing that trailer instead of putting a truck under it and the only trucking we do is our own personal little stuff so uh i just i mean id be id be wasting your time to you know to do it because i know im not gon na you know see ooour in the near future i dont see me you know doing anything right now
__label__0 um im actually may im going to uh a meeting here at nine thirty wwhat chu got on your mind
__label__0 weh let me ask are you you talkin about uh leasing trucks and things of that nature
__label__0 right okay okay you know uh in that situation we uh we maintain our own trucks we have our own shop and uh we maintain our own uh uh own call uh you know dispatch and well go out to the road and then uh we actually own all of our vehicles so thats been the philosophy of the you know its a privately owned company its been that philosophy for uh you know about fifty years is to own our fleet so im really you know not interested in any kind of uh any kind of lease or any kind of roadside service or maintenance
__label__0 uh you know our warranty work we we take back to the manufacturers and and they perform that um we we do actually do major um overhauls and uh and um inframe type rebuilding in the engines um you know i guess the two things that we body work we we dont do and uh transmissions we dont do
__label__0 um you know im really really not interested because we we have uh you thosethings kind of set up where we have vendors that we use and uh you know i just dont wan na waste your time or mind either because were not interested at this time in changing
__label__0 yeah they they i mean they are in here on monday through saturday or whatever andlike this and most of the equipment is out here you know its out and its back or whatever so
__label__0 like i said we always got trailers rolling back in and out so now do a good job
__label__0 then like i said if its uhh engine work or whatever most time it is covered under warranty because weve got aaa the built five seventy nines
__label__0 um you know joe the thing of it is were a capital acquisition company and we dont uh we dont use any leasing or anything like that everything we we do we acquire and uh kinda run a good program like that so uh he can stop in and and give it to me but uh you know uh i dont want to waste anybodys time either joe
__label__0 hey where where is he going to land head office is in bloody helmont im in edmonton quite regularly too i can meet him there
__label__0 okay tell tell you what why dont you just have him reach out to me directly on this number and uh he and i can coordinate meeting ill be up in edmonton some time
__label__0 uhhhh two international box trucks a hino box a hino box truck uhh gmc pickup
__label__0 the one other international i think is ofive and the hino is i think twelve or thirteen
__label__0 as ryan ryan runs a lot of the umm as far as doing the maintenance on the trucks as far as running back and forth
__label__0 uhhhmm i dont know if im going aa i have a pickup here that i might replace within days but like i havent decided yet
__label__0 here ill be honest with you i got a three by shop and im the only mechanic so
__label__0 we probably had six bigger trucks but no were not real big coop but no here and
__label__0 were just were a small shop and we dont get into that kind of stuff so
__label__0 no im walking between two building right now some girl just hold me in her office
__label__0 ummm my extension is two fourteen but im going to be slammed until next monday or tuesday if you can call me then
__label__0 uhhhumm no im kind of busy is is this ummm about a rental that we have or
__label__0 ummm actually im just about to go into a meeting umm can we can you check in with us at another time
__label__0 yeah yeah so what i would like to do is i have i have someone who is going to take pick this up again soon and hell take the lead on it
__label__0 if you can uhhh if you send me a uhhhh emal then i can forward that on to that individual and he can get back to you
__label__0 yeah because we got screwed big time on the contract the last time and my boss will fire me if he walk on the property
__label__0 i mean i am i just sign a longterm lease with with uhhh paclease for a uhhh little dump truck that theyre building for us
__label__0 no because that thats something that was just uhh especially truck we had a build for us
__label__0 okay okay ummm sure now and youll have uhhhh and were talking about our heavy duty commercial vehicles right
__label__0 well you know what i have ummm at first i always try to keep them out of the shop
__label__0 ill have anyone ummm but just send us some information we love to look at it because we it might help us out when uhh if we ever need to rent one
__label__0 we have a two thousand seven volvo tractor we have two thousand and uhh lets see hold on we have forty nine we have two thousand international forty waa foury nine hundred
__label__0 and we have ummm the two thousand seven volvo and of course a ninety six international
__label__0 ummm i think were good for now we we have a longterm lease and im not looking for any other options at this point other than a possible rental
__label__0 you know we have talked to uhhh to umm i guess both penske and ryder but yeah we are not looking to leasing anything or purchasing anything this year uhhhhh we may add something next year but uhh we decided to actually purchase vehicles over leasing uhhh we bought you we have an onsite mechanic of the thing so they do all our maintenance i understand you guys offer that as well as well as ryder
__label__0 right but you know what we do is aaa just basically rent from you guys thats thats the only thing we might try to do that for now
__label__0 yeah you know i think our local rep i cant tell you his name right now
__label__0 yeah and so we had this discussion and i think well yeah were probably at this point we got a pretty new facility uhhh in the last three and half four years and
__label__0 he is in a meeting right now but uhhh yeah he can he can uhh schedule an appointment with brian
__label__0 no no were not going to do full service lease and i didnt talk to you about that and then and uhh i already have i already have good maintenance system in place so
__label__0 lets yeah we are only were and we were in some options with you guys but uhhh but you know what kinda spot you got
__label__0 ill probably buy ill probably buy two three units this year and i probably wont need major repair so
__label__0 so i mean right now it wouldnt be a good time to you know we will probably be accomplishing things
__label__0 uhh this doesnt thing seem yeah yeah okay i will ill give you a call and uhh if if anything changes well give you a call well give you first opportunity okay
__label__0 i can honestly tell you i am damn the only three drivers so i really dont think we are interested in anything at this time
__label__0 uhhhmmm you know what right now i think i am going to pass we have got a lot of things on our plate i think we aregoing to pass i want to pass right now call me back may be in a month or so
__label__0 uh probably im im i think we are fine i mean we dont we dont use to do any rentals or or anything like that so
__label__0 uhhh ill be honest with you im a im a real small company and ive been in the business for a longtime and we dont advertise and just everything is running smooth for me so i really appreciate it
__label__0 yeah we arent we arent adding any vehicles to our fleet in two thousand and seventeen and the ones we are adding were purchasing so
__label__0 we are not considering we are not considering any uhh lease fields at this point
__label__0 so you thought that we have bought uhhh you know trucks for our business and we dont need leasing anymore
__label__0 yeah yeah we have uhh company on beaupit highway that that maimaintain our trucks and uhh we we appreciate your call
__label__0 well i think we are already in the process of getting setup with you guys for rental on our trucks
__label__0 well uhhh donna is our person who is kind of head overall the trucks and rentals and stuff like that but we buy our trucks we dont lease any of them
__label__0 okay see uhh were good with that the problem we have got is our forklifts dont really put those many hours so just that contract and the trucks dont put those many miles on them so we guys do it on as needed basis first
__label__0 okay tell me what its about first whats it regarding that youre saying our vehicles
__label__0 uh yeah but we really dont have per say a company vehicle i do have i mean uh some of our company vehicles but its not itss not like its um i mean i cant remember the last time we actually had to deliver anything we have installers that actually take things out so its not like we have a company vehicle that gets used on a regular basis for the company
